This book is intended as a support for the course of STAT 463 (Applied Time Series Analysis) given at Penn State University. It contains an overview of the basic procedures to adequately approach a time series analysis with insight to more advanced analysis of time series. It firstly introduces the basic concepts and theory to appropriately use the applied tools that are presented in the second (and main) part of the book. In the latter part the reader will learn how to use descriptive analysis to identify the important characteristics of a time series and then employ modelling and inference techniques (made available through R funtions) that allow to describe a time series and make predictions. The last part of the book will give introductory notions on more advanced analysis of time series where the reader will achieve a basic understanding of the tools available to analyse more complex characteristics of time series.

For example: a = pi b = 0.5 sin(a*b) Similarly, R output lines (that usally appear in your Console) will begin with ## and will not be syntax highlighted. The output of the above example is the following: ## [1] 1 Aside from R code and its outputs, this book will also insert some boxes that will draw the reader’s attention to important, curious or otherwise informative details. An example of these boxes was seen at the beginning of this introduction where an important aspect was pointed out to the reader regarding the “under construction” nature of this book. Therefore the following boxes and symbols can be used to represent information of different nature: This is an important piece of information. This is some additional information that could be useful to the reader. This is something that the reader should pay caution to but should not create major problems if not considered. This is a warning which should be heeded by the reader to avoid problems of different nature. This is a tip for the reader when following or developing something based on this book. Using the same convention as in Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani (2001), the symbol 😱 indicates a technically difficult section which may be skipped without interrupting the flow of the discussion. 1.2 Bibliographic Note This is not the first (or the last) book that has been written on time series analysis. Indeed, this can be seen as a book that brings together and reorganizes information and material from other sources structuring and tailoring it to a course in basic time series analysis. The main and excellent references (which are far from being an exhaustive review of literature) that can be used to have a more in-depth view of different aspects treated in this book are Cochrane (2005), Hamilton (1994) and Shumway and Stoffer (2010). 1.3 Acknowledgements The text has benefited greatly from the contributions of many people who have provided extremely useful comments, suggestions and corrections.

These libraries can be install as follows: install.packages(c(&quot;devtools&quot;, &quot;astsa&quot;, &quot;mgcv&quot;)) devtools::install_github(&quot;SMAC-Group/simts&quot;) and simply load them using: library(astsa) library(mgcv) library(simts) We can start the discussion on the basic elements of time series by using a practical example from real data made available through the R software. The data represent the global mean land–ocean temperature shifts from 1880 to 2015 (with base index being the average temperatures from 1951 to 1980) and this time series is represented in the plot below. # Load data data(globtemp, package = &quot;astsa&quot;) # Construct gts object globtemp = gts(globtemp, start = 1880, freq = 1, unit_ts = &quot;C&quot;, name_ts = &quot;Global Temperature Deviations&quot;, data_name = &quot;Evolution of Global Temperatures&quot;) # Plot time series plot(globtemp) These data have been used as a support in favour of the argument that the global temperatures are increasing and that global warming has occured over the last half of the twentieth century. The first approach that one would take is to try and measure the average increase by fitting a model having the form: \\[ X_t = f(t) + \\varepsilon_t, \\] where \\(X_t\\) denotes the global temperatures deviation and \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is a “smooth” function such that \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_t] - f(t) = 0\\) for all \\(t\\). In general, \\(\\varepsilon_t\\) is assumed to follow a normal distribution for simplicity. The goal in this context would therefore be to evaluate if \\(f(t)\\) (or a suitable estimator of this function) is an increasing function (especially over the last decades). In order to do so, we would require the residuals from the fitted model to be independently and identically distributed (iid). Let us fit a (nonparametric) model with the years (time) as explanatory variable using the code below: time = gts_time(globtemp) fit = gam(globtemp ~ s(time)) and check the residuals from this model using: simts::simple_diag_plot(globtemp, fit) It can be seen from the upper left plot that the trend appears to be removed and, if looking at the residuals as one would usually do in a regression framework, the residual plots seem to suggest that the modelling has done a relatively good job since no particular pattern seems to emerge and their distribution is quite close to being Gaussian. However, is it possible to conclude from the plots that the data are iid (i.e. independent and identically distributed)? More specifically, can we assume that the residuals are independent? This is a fundamental question in order for inference procedures to be carried out in an appropriate manner and to limit false conclusions. Let us provide an example through a simulated data set where we know that there is an upward trend through time and our goal would be to show that this trend exists. In order to do so we consider a simple model where \\(f(t)\\) has a simple parametric form, i.e. \\(f(t) = \\beta \\cdot t\\) and we employ the following data generating process: \\[X_t = \\beta \\cdot t + Y_t,\\] where \\[Y_t = \\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \\varepsilon_t,\\] and where \\(\\varepsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\\). Intuitively, \\(Y_t\\) is not an iid sequence of random variables except in the case where \\(\\phi_1 = \\phi_2 = 0\\). In the following chapters we shall see that this intuition is correct and that this model is known as an AR(2) model. Considering this, we simulate two cases where, in the first, the residuals are actually iid Gaussian while, in the second, the residuals are Gaussian but are dependent over time. In the first case, the only parameters that explain \\(X_t\\) are \\(\\beta = 5 \\cdot 10^{-3}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\) since the residuals \\(Y_t\\) are iid (i.e. \\(\\phi_1 = \\phi_2 = 0\\)). In the second case however, aside from the mentioned parameters we also have \\(\\phi_1 = 0.8897\\), \\(\\phi_2 = -0.4858\\). In both cases, we perform the hypothesis test: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{H}_0:&amp; \\;\\;\\; \\beta = 0\\\\ \\text{H}_1:&amp; \\;\\;\\; \\beta &gt; 0 \\end{aligned} \\] as our hope is to prove, similarly to the global temperature deviation example, that \\(f(t)\\) is an increasing function. Our syntetic data are simulated as follows: # Set seed for reproducibility set.seed(9) # Define sample size n = 100 # Define beta beta = 0.005 # Define sigma2 sigma2 = 1 # Simulation of Yt Yt_case1 = gen_gts(WN(sigma2 = sigma2), n = n) Yt_case2 = gen_gts(AR(phi = c(0.95, -0.5), sigma2 = sigma2), n = n) # Define explanatory variable (time) time = 1:n # Simulation of Xt Xt_case1 = beta*time + Yt_case1 Xt_case2 = beta*time + Yt_case2 # Fit a linear models model1 &lt;- lm(Xt_case1 ~ time + 0) model2 &lt;- lm(Xt_case2 ~ time + 0) The “summary” of our model on the first dataset is given by summary(model1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Xt_case1 ~ time + 0) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.5985 -0.7023 -0.1398 0.4444 2.7098 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Hence, from this inference procedure we can conclude at the 5% significance level that the slope is significantly larger than zero and is roughly equal to 0.004 (which is relatively close to the truth). However, let us perform the same analysis when the residuals are not independent (the second case) by examining its “summary”: summary(model2) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Xt_case2 ~ time + 0) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -3.6916 -1.1184 0.2323 1.1253 2.6198 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Consequently, we don’t have evidence to conclude that the slope coefficient is larger than zero (i.e. we fail to reject H\\(_0\\)) although it is actually so in reality. Therefore, the inference procedures can be misleading when not taking into account other possible significant variables or, in this case, forms of dependence that can hide true underlying effects. The above is only one example and there are therefore cases where, despite dependence in the residuals, the estimated slope would be deemed significant even when not considering this dependence structure. However, if we decided to repeat this experiment using a larger quantity of simulated samples, we would probably see that we fail to reject the null hypothesis much more frequently in the case where we don’t consider dependence when there actually is. These examples therefore highlight how the approach to analysing time series does not only rely on finding an appropriate model that describes the evolution of a variable as a function of time (which is deterministic). Indeed, one of the main focuses of time series analysis consists in modelling the dependence structure that describes how random variables impact each other as a function of time. In other words, a time series is a collection of random variables whose interaction and dependence structure is indexed by time. Based on this structure, one of the main goals of time series analysis is to correctly estimate the dependence mechanism and consequently deliver forecasts that are as accurate as possible considering the deterministic functions of time (and other variables) as well as the random dependence structure. 2.1 The Wold Decomposition The previous discussion highlighted how a time series can be decomposed into a deterministic component and a random component. Leaving aside technical rigour, this characteristic of time series was put forward in Wold’s Decomposition Theorem who postulated that a time series \\((Y_t)\\) (where \\(t = 1,...,n\\) represents the time index) can be very generically represented as follows: \\[Y_t = D_t + W_t,\\] where \\(D_t\\) represents the deterministic part (or signal) that can be modelled through the standard modelling techniques (e.g. linear regression) and \\(W_t\\) that, restricting ourselves to a general class of processes, represents the random part (noise) that requires the analytical and modelling approaches that will be tackled in this book. Typically, we have \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y_t] \\neq 0\\) while \\(\\mathbb{E}[W_t] = 0\\) (although we may have \\(\\mathbb{E}[W_t | W_{t-1}, ..., W_1] \\neq 0\\)). Such models impose some parametric structure which represents a convenient and flexible way of studying time series as well as a means to evaluate future values of the series through forecasting. As we will see, predicting future values is one of the main aspects of time series analysis. However, making predictions is often a daunting task or as famously stated by Nils Bohr: “Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.” There are plenty of examples of predictions that turned out to be completely erroneous. For example, three days before the 1929 crash, Irving Fisher, Professor of Economics at Yale University, famously predicted: “Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau”. Another example is given by Thomas Watson, president of IBM, who said in 1943: “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” Let us now briefly discuss the two components of a time series. 2.1.1 The Deterministic Component (Signal) Before shifting our focus to the random component of time series, we will first just underline the main features that should be taken into account for the deterministic component. The first feature that should be analysed is the trend that characterises the time series, more specifically the behaviour of the variable of interest as a specific function of time (as the global temperature time series seen earlier). Let us consider another example borrowed from Shumway and Stoffer (2010) of time series based on real data, i.e. the quarterly earnings of Johnson &amp; Johnson between 1960 and 1980 represented below. # Load data data(jj, package = &quot;astsa&quot;) # Construct gts object jj = gts(jj, start = 1960, freq = 4, unit_ts = &quot;$&quot;, name_ts = &quot;Quarterly Earnings per Share&quot;, data_name = &quot;Johnson &amp; Johnson Quarterly Earnings&quot;) # Plot time series plot(jj) As can be seen from the plot, the earnings appear to grow over time, therefore we can imagine fitting a straight line to this data to describe its behaviour by considering the following model: \\[\\begin{equation} X_t = \\alpha + \\beta t + \\varepsilon_t, \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\varepsilon_t\\) is iid Gaussian. The results are presented in the graph below: # Fit linear regression time_jj = gts_time(jj) fit_jj1 = lm(as.vector(jj) ~ time_jj) # Plot results and add regression line plot(jj) lines(time_jj, predict(fit_jj1), col = &quot;red&quot;) legend(&quot;bottomright&quot;, c(&quot;Time series&quot;, &quot;Regression line&quot;), col = c(&quot;blue4&quot;, &quot;red&quot;), bty = &quot;n&quot;, lwd = 1) Although the line captures a part of the behaviour, it is quite clear that the trend of the time series is not linear as can be observed from the diagnotic plot below: simple_diag_plot(jj, fit_jj1) It could therefore be more appropriate to define another function of time to describe it and, consequently, we add a quadratic term of time to obtain the following fit. Therefore, the model considered in (2.1) becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} X_t = \\alpha + \\beta_1 t + \\beta_2 t^2 + \\varepsilon_t, \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] The results of this regression are presented on the graphs below: simple_diag_plot(jj, fit_jj2) We can see now that the quadratic function of time allows to better fit the observed time series and closely follow the observations. However, there still appears to be a pattern in the data that isn’t captured by this quadratic model. This pattern appears to be repeated over time: peaks and valleys that seem to occur at regular intervals along the time series. This behaviour is known as seasonality which, in this case, can be explained by the effect of a specific quarter on the behaviour of the earnings. Indeed, it is reasonable to assume that the seasons have impacts on different variables measured over time (e.g. temperatures, earnings linked to sales that vary with seasons, etc.). Let us therefore take the quarters as an explanatory variable and add it to the model considered in (2.2), which becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} X_t = \\alpha + \\beta_1 t + \\beta_2 t^2 + \\sum_{i = 1}^4 \\gamma_i I_{t \\in \\mathcal{A}_i} + \\varepsilon_t, \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\[\\begin{equation*} I_{t \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\equiv \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\mbox{if } t \\in \\mathcal{A} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mbox{if } t \\not\\in \\mathcal{A} \\end{array} \\right. , \\end{equation*}\\] and where \\[ \\mathcal{A}_i \\equiv \\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{N} | x = i \\; \\text{mod} \\; 4\\right\\}. \\] The results are presented below: simple_diag_plot(jj, fit_jj3) This final fit appears to well describe the behaviour of the earnings although there still appears to be a problem of heteroskedasticity (i.e. change in variance) and random seasonality (both of which will be treated further on in this text). Hence, trend and seasonality are the main features that characterize the deterministic component of a time series. However, as discussed earlier, these deterministic components often don’t explain all of the observed time series since there is often a random component characterizing data measured over time. Not considering the latter component can have considerable impacts on the inference procedures (as seen earlier) and it is therefore important to adequately analyse them (see next section). 2.1.2 The Random Component (Noise) From this section onwards we will refer to time series as being solely the random noise component. Keeping this in mind, a time series is a particular kind of stochastic process which, generally speaking, is a collection of random variables indexed by a set of numbers. Not surprisingly, the index of reference for a time series is given by time and, consequently, a time series is a collection of random variables indexed (or “measured”) over time such as, for example, the daily price of a financial asset or the monthly average temperature in a given location. In terms of notation, a time series is often represented as \\[\\left(X_1, X_2, ..., X_T \\right) \\;\\;\\; \\text{ or } \\;\\;\\; \\left(X_t\\right)_{t = 1,...,T}.\\] The time index \\(t\\) is contained within either the set of reals, \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), or integers, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). When \\(t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), the time series becomes a continuous-time stochastic process such as a Brownian motion, a model used to represent the random movement of particles within a suspended liquid or gas. However, within this book, we will limit ourselves to the cases where \\(t \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), better known as discrete-time processes. Discrete-time processes are measured sequentially at fixed and equally spaced intervals in time. This implies that we will uphold two general assumptions for the time series considered in this book: \\(t\\) is not random, e.g. the time at which each observation is measured is known, and the time between two consecutive observations is constant. This book will also focus on certain representations of time series based on parametric probabilistic models. For example, one of the fundamental probability models used in time series analysis is called the white noise model and is defined as \\[X_t \\mathop \\sim \\limits^{iid} N(0, \\sigma^2).\\] This statement simply means that \\((X_t)\\) is normally distributed and independent over time. Ideally, this is the type of process that we would want to observe once we have performed a statistical modelling procedure. However, despite it appearing to be an excessively simple model to be considered for time series, it is actually a crucial component to construct a wide range of more complex time series models (see Chapter 3). Indeed, unlike the white noise process, time series are typically not independent over time. For example, if we suppose that the temperature in State College is unusually low on a given day, then it is reasonable to assume that the temperature the day after will also be low. With this in mind, let us now give a quick overview of the information that can be retrieved on a time series from a simple descriptive representation. 2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis for Time Series When dealing with relatively small time series (e.g. a few thousands or less), it is often useful to look at a graph of the original data. A graph can be an informative tool for “detecting” some features of a time series such as trends and the presence of outliers. This is indeed what was done in the previous paragraphs when analysing the global temperature data or the Johnson &amp; Johnson data. To go more in depth with respect to the previous paragraphs, a trend is typically assumed to be present in a time series when the data exhibit some form of long term increase or decrease or combination of increases or decreases. Such trends could be linear or non-linear and represent an important part of the “signal” of a model (as seen for the Johnson &amp; Johnson time series). Here are a few examples of non-linear trends: Seasonal trends (periodic): These are the cyclical patterns which repeat after a fixed/regular time period. This could be due to business cycles (e.g. bust/recession, recovery). Non-seasonal trends (periodic): These patterns cannot be associated to seasonal variation and can for example be due to an external variable such as, for example, the impact of economic indicators on stock returns. Note that such trends are often hard to detect based on a graphical analysis of the data. “Other” trends: These trends have typically no regular patterns and are over a segment of time, known as a “window”, that change the statistical properties of a time series. A common example of such trends is given by the vibrations observed before, during and after an earthquake. Moreover, when observing “raw” time series data it is also interesting to evaluate if some of the following phenomena occur: Change in Mean: Does the mean of the process shift over time? Change in Variance: Does the variance of the process evolve with time? Change in State: Does the time series appear to change between “states” having distinct statistical properties? Outliers Does the time series contain some “extreme” observations? (Note that this is typically difficult to assess visually.) Example 2.1 In the figure below, we present an example of displacement recorded during an earthquake as well as an explosion. data(EQ5, package = &quot;astsa&quot;) data(EXP6, package = &quot;astsa&quot;) # Construct gts object eq5 &lt;- gts(EQ5, start = 0, freq = 1, unit_ts = &quot;p/s&quot;, name_ts = &quot;Earthquake Arrival Phases&quot;, data_name = &quot;Earthquake Arrival Phases&quot;) exp6 &lt;- gts(EXP6, start = 0, freq = 1, unit_ts = &quot;p/s&quot;, name_ts = &quot;Explosion Arrival Phases&quot;, data_name = &quot;Explosion Arrival Phases&quot;) # Plot time series plot(eq5) plot(exp6) From the graph, it can be observed that the statistical properties of the time series appear to change over time. For instance, the variance of the time series shifts at around \\(t = 1150\\) for both series. The shift in variance also opens “windows” where there appear to be distinct states. In the case of the explosion data, this is particularly relevant around \\(t = 50, \\cdots, 250\\) and then again from \\(t = 1200, \\cdots, 1500\\). Even within these windows, there are “spikes” that could be considered as outliers most notably around \\(t = 1200\\) in the explosion series. Extreme observations or outliers are commonly observed in real time series data, this is illustrated in the following example. Example 2.2 We consider here a data set coming from the domain of hydrology. The data concerns monthly precipitation (in mm) over a certain period of time (1907 to 1972) and is interesting for scientists in order to study water cycles. The data are presented in the graph below: # Load hydro dataset data(&quot;hydro&quot;) # Simulate based on data hydro = gts(as.vector(hydro), start = 1907, freq = 12, unit_ts = &quot;in.&quot;, name_ts = &quot;Precipitation&quot;, data_name = &quot;Hydrology data&quot;) # Plot hydro plot(hydro) We can see how most observations lie below 2mm but there appear to be different observations that go beyond this and appear to be larger than the others. These could be possible outliers that can greatly affect the estimation procedure if not taken adequately into account. Next, we consider an example coming from high-frequency finance. The figure below presents the returns or price innovations (i.e. the changes in price from one observation to the next) for Starbuck’s stock on July 1, 2011 for about 150 seconds (left panel) and about 400 minutes (right panel). # Load &quot;high-frequency&quot; Starbucks returns for July 01 2011 data(sbux.xts, package = &quot;highfrequency&quot;) # Plot returns par(mfrow = c(1,2)) plot(gts(sbux.xts[1:89]), main = &quot;Starbucks: 150 Seconds&quot;, ylab = &quot;Returns&quot;) plot(gts(sbux.xts), main = &quot;Starbucks: 400 Minutes&quot;, ylab = &quot;Returns&quot;) It can be observed on the left panel that observations are not equally spaced. Indeed, in high-frequency data the intervals between two points are typically not constant and are, even worse, random variables. This implies that the time when a new observation will be available is in general unknown. On the right panel, one can observe that the variability of the data seems to change during the course of the trading day. Such a phenomenon is well known in the finance community since a lot of variation occurs at the start (and the end) of the day while the middle of the day is associated with small changes. Moreover, clear extreme observations can also be noted in this graph at around 11:00. Example 2.3 Finally, let us consider the limitations of a direct graphical representation of a time series when the sample size is large. Indeed, due to visual limitations, a direct plotting of the data will probably result in an uninformative aggregation of points between which it is unable to distinguish anything. This is illustrated in the following example. We consider here the data coming from the calibration procedure of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which, in general terms, is used to enhance navigation precision or reconstruct three dimensional movements: These sensors are used in a very wide range of applications such as robotics, virtual reality 🐻, vehicle stability control, human and animal motion capture and so forth: The signals coming from these instruments are measured at high frequencies over a long time and are often characterized by linear trends and numerous underlying stochastic processes. The code below retrieves some data from an IMU and plots it directly: To access the IMU time series represented below you must install the imudata package which can be found at this link. # Load IMU data data(imu6, package = &quot;imudata&quot;) # Construct gst object Xt = gts(imu6[,1], data_name = &quot;Gyroscope data&quot;, unit_time = &quot;hour&quot;, freq = 100*60*60, name_ts = &quot;Angular rate&quot;, unit_ts = bquote(rad^2/s^2)) # Plot time series plot(Xt) Although a linear trend and other processes are present in this signal (time series), it is practically impossible to understand or guess anything from the plot. For this reason, other types of representations are available to understand the behaviour of a time series and will be discussed in the next chapter. Having discussed these representations (and the relative issues with these representations) let us present the basic parametric models that are used to build even more complex models to describe and predict the behaviour of a time series. 2.3 Modelling Time Series Before discussing the basic time series models used to describe and forecast, we briefly discuss the concept of dependence within time series. 2.3.1 Dependence within Time Series As mentioned earlier, it is straightforward to assume that observations measured through time are dependent on each other (in that observations at time \\(t\\) have some form of impact on observations at time \\(t+1\\) or beyond). Due to this characteristic, one of the main interests in time series is prediction where, if \\((X_t)_{t=1,\\ldots,T}\\) is an identically distributed but not independent sequence, we often want to know the value of \\({X}_{T+h}\\) for \\(h &gt; 0\\) (i.e. an estimator of \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_{T+h}| X_T,...]\\)). In order to tackle this issue, we first need to understand the dependence between \\(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{T}\\) and, even before this, we have to formally define what independence is. Definition 2.1 (Independence of Events) Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent if \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(A)\\mathbb{P}(B), \\end{align*}\\] with \\(\\mathbb{P}(A)\\) denoting the probability of event \\(A\\) occuring and \\(\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B)\\) denoting the joint probability (i.e. the probability that events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur jointly). In general, \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\) are independent if \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbb{P}(A_1 \\ldots A_n) = \\mathbb{P}(A_1) \\ldots \\mathbb{P}(A_n) \\;\\; \\forall \\; A_i \\in S, \\;\\; i=1,\\ldots,n \\end{align*}\\] where \\(S\\) is the sample space. Definition 2.2 (Independence of Random Variables) Two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF) \\(F_X(x)\\) and \\(F_Y(y)\\), respectively, are independent if and only if their joint CDF \\(F_{X,Y}(x,y)\\) is such that \\[\\begin{align*} F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_{X}(x) F_{Y}(y). \\end{align*}\\] In general, random variables \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) with CDF \\(F_{X_1}(x_1), \\ldots, F_{X_n}(x_n)\\) are respectively independent if and only if their joint CDF \\(F_{X_1, \\ldots, X_n}(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\\) is such that \\[\\begin{align*} F_{X_1,\\ldots,X_n}(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = F_{X_1}(x_1) \\ldots F_{X_n}(x_n). \\end{align*}\\] Definition 2.3 (iid sequence) The sequence \\(X_{1},X_{2},\\ldots,X_{T}\\) is said to be independent and identically distributed (i.e. iid) if and only if \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbb{P}(X_{i}&lt;x) = \\mathbb{P}(X_{j}&lt;x) \\;\\; \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\forall i,j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,T\\}, \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbb{P}(X_{1}&lt;x_{1},X_{2}&lt;x_{2},\\ldots,X_{T}&lt;x_{T})=\\mathbb{P}(X_{1}&lt;x_1) \\ldots \\mathbb{P}(X_{T}&lt;x_T) \\;\\; \\forall T\\geq2, x_1, \\ldots, x_T \\in \\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\] The basic idea behind the above definitions of independence is the fact that the probability of an event regarding variable \\(X_i\\) remains unaltered no matter what occurs for variable \\(X_j\\) (for \\(i \\neq j\\)). However, for time series, this is often not the case and \\(X_t\\) often has some impact on \\(X_{t+h}\\) for some \\(h\\) (not too large). In order to explain (and predict) the impact of an observation on future observations, a series of models have been adopted through the years thereby providing a comprehensive framework to explain dependence through time. The following paragraphs introduce some of these basic models. 2.3.2 Basic Time Series Models In this section, we introduce some simple time series models that consitute the building blocks for the more complex and flexible classes of time series commonly used in practice. Before doing so it is useful to define \\(\\Omega_t\\) as all the information available up to time \\(t-1\\), i.e. \\[\\Omega_t \\equiv \\left(X_{t-1}, X_{t-2}, ..., X_0 \\right).\\] As we will see further on, this compact notation is quite useful. 2.3.3 White Noise As we saw earlier, the white noise model is the building block for most time series models and, to better specify the notation used throughout this book, this model is defined as \\[{W_t}\\mathop \\sim \\limits^{iid} N\\left( {0,\\sigma _w^2} \\right).\\] This definition implies that: \\(\\mathbb{E}[W_t | \\Omega_t] = 0\\) for all \\(t\\), \\(\\text{cov}\\left(W_t, W_{t-h} \\right) = \\boldsymbol{1}_{h = 0} \\; \\sigma^2\\) for all \\(t, h\\). More specifically, \\(h \\in \\mathbb{N}^+\\) is the time difference between lagged variables. Therefore, in this process there is an absence of temporal (or serial) correlation and it is homoskedastic (i.e. it has a constant variance). Going into further details, white noise can be categorzied into two sorts of processes: weak and strong. The process \\((W_t)\\) is a weak white noise if \\(\\mathbb{E}[W_t] = 0\\) for all \\(t\\), \\(\\text{var}\\left(W_t\\right) = \\sigma_w^2\\) for all \\(t\\), \\(\\text{cov} \\left(W_t, W_{t-h}\\right) = 0\\) for all \\(t\\) and for all \\(h \\neq 0\\). Note that this definition does not imply that \\(W_t\\) and \\(W_{t-h}\\) are independent (for \\(h \\neq 0\\)) but simply uncorrelated. However, the notion of independence is used to define a strong white noise as \\(\\mathbb{E}[W_t] = 0\\) and \\(\\text{var}(W_t) = \\sigma^2 &lt; \\infty\\), for all \\(t\\), \\(F(W_t) = F(W_{t-h})\\) for all \\(t,h\\) (where \\(F(W_t)\\) denotes the marginal distribution of \\(W_t\\)), \\(W_t\\) and \\(W_{t-h}\\) are independent for all \\(t\\) and for all \\(h \\neq 0\\). It is clear from these definitions that if a process is a strong white noise it is also a weak white noise. However, the converse is not true as shown in the following example: Example 2.4 Let \\(Y_t \\mathop \\sim F_{t+2}\\), where \\(F_{t+2}\\) denotes a Student distribution with \\(t+2\\) degrees of freedom. Assuming the sequence \\((Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)\\) to be independent, we let \\(X_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{t+2}} Y_t\\). Then, the process \\((X_t)\\) is obviously not a strong white noise as the distribution of \\(X_t\\) changes with \\(t\\). However this process is a weak white noise since we have: \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{t+2}} \\mathbb{E}[Y_t] = 0\\) for all \\(t\\). \\(\\text{var}(X_t) = \\frac{t}{t+2} \\text{var}(Y_t) = \\frac{t}{t+2} \\frac{t+2}{t} = 1\\) for all \\(t\\). \\(\\text{cov}(X_t, X_{t+h}) = 0\\) (by independence), for all \\(t\\), and for all \\(h \\neq 0\\). This distinction is therefore important and will be extremely relevant when discussing the concept of “stationarity” further on in this book. In general, the white noise model is assumed to be Gaussian in many practical cases and the code below presents an example of how to simulate a Gaussian white noise process. n = 1000 # process length sigma2 = 1 # process variance Xt = gen_gts(n, WN(sigma2 = sigma2)) plot(Xt) This model can be found in different applied settings and is often accompanied by some of the models presented in the following paragraphs. 2.3.4 Random Walk The term random walk was first introduced by Karl Pearson in the early nineteen-hundreds and a wide range of random walk models have been defined over the years. For example, one of the simplest forms of a random walk process can be explained as follows: suppose that you are walking on campus and your next step can either be to your left, your right, forward or backward (each with equal probability). Two realizations of such processes are represented below: set.seed(5) RW2dimension(steps = 10^2) RW2dimension(steps = 10^4) Such processes inspired Karl Pearson’s famous quote that “the most likely place to find a drunken walker is somewhere near his starting point.” Empirical evidence of this phenomenon is not too hard to find on a Friday or Saturday night. This two-dimensional process may easily be extended to three dimensions and a simulated example of such a process is presented in the animation below: In this text, we only consider one very specific form of random walk, namely the Gaussian random walk which can be defined as: \\[X_t = X_{t-1} + W_t,\\] where \\(W_t\\) is a Gaussian white noise process with initial condition \\(X_0 = c\\) (typically \\(c = 0\\).) This process can be expressed differently by backsubstitution as follows: \\[\\begin{aligned} {X_t} &amp;= {X_{t - 1}} + {W_t} \\\\ &amp;= \\left( {{X_{t - 2}} + {W_{t - 1}}} \\right) + {W_t} \\\\ &amp;= \\vdots \\\\ {X_t} &amp;= \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} + X_0 = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} + c \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] A random variable following a random walk can therefore be expressed as the cumulated sum of all the random variables that precede it. The code below presents an example of how to simulate a such process. n = 1000 # process length gamma2 = 1 # innovation variance Xt = gen_gts(n, RW(gamma2 = gamma2)) plot(Xt) The random walk model is often used to explain phenomena in many different areas one of which is finance where stock prices follow these kind of processes. 2.3.5 First-Order Autoregressive Model A first-order autoregressive model or AR(1) is a generalization of both the white noise and the random walk processes which are both special cases of an AR(1). A (Gaussian) AR(1) process can be defined as \\[{X_t} = {\\phi}{X_{t - 1}} + {W_t},\\] where \\(W_t\\) is a Gaussian white noise. Clearly, an AR(1) with \\(\\phi = 0\\) is a Gaussian white noise and when \\(\\phi = 1\\) the process becomes a random walk. Remark 2.1 An AR(1) is in fact a linear combination of past realisations of a white noise \\(W_t\\) process. Indeed, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} {X_t} &amp;= {\\phi_t}{X_{t - 1}} + {W_t} = {\\phi}\\left( {{\\phi}{X_{t - 2}} + {W_{t - 1}}} \\right) + {W_t} \\\\ &amp;= \\phi^2{X_{t - 2}} + {\\phi}{W_{t - 1}} + {W_t} = {\\phi^t}{X_0} + \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{t - 1} {\\phi^i{W_{t - i}}}. \\end{aligned}\\] Under the assumption of infinite past (i.e. \\(t \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\)) and \\(|\\phi| &lt; 1\\), we obtain \\[X_t = \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{\\infty} {\\phi^i {W_{t - i}}},\\] since \\(\\operatorname{lim}_{i \\to \\infty} \\; {\\phi^i}{X_{t-i}} = 0\\). From the conclusion of the above the remark, you may have noticed how we assume that the considered time series have zero expectation. The following remark justifies this assumption. Remark 2.2 We generally assume that an AR(1), as well as other time series models, have zero mean. The reason for this assumption is only to simplfy the notation but it is easy to consider, for example, an AR(1) process around an arbitrary mean \\(\\mu\\), i.e. \\[\\left(X_t - \\mu\\right) = \\phi \\left(X_{t-1} - \\mu \\right) + W_t,\\] which is of course equivalent to \\[X_t = \\left(1 - \\phi \\right) \\mu + \\phi X_{t-1} + W_t.\\] Thus, we will generally only work with zero mean processes since adding means is simple. As for the previously presented models, we provide the code that gives an example of how an AR(1) can be simulated. n = 1000 # process length phi = 0.5 # phi parameter sigma2 = 1 # innovation variance Xt = gen_gts(n, AR1(phi = phi, sigma2 = sigma2)) plot(Xt) The AR(1) model is one of the most popular and commonly used models in many practical settings going from biology where it is used to explain the evolution of gene expressions to economics where it is used to model macroeconomic trends. 2.3.6 Moving Average Process of Order 1 As seen in the previous example, an AR(1) can be expressed as a linear combination of all past observations of the white noise process \\((W_t)\\). In a similar manner we can (in some sense) describe the moving average process of order 1 or MA(1) as a “truncated” version of an AR(1). This model is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} X_t = \\theta W_{t-1} + W_t, \\end{equation}\\] where (again) \\(W_t\\) denotes a Gaussian white noise process. As we will see further on, as for the AR(1) model, this model can also be represented as a linear combination of past observations but it has different characteristics which can capture different types of dynamics in various practical cases. An example on how to generate an MA(1) is given below: n = 1000 # process length sigma2 = 1 # innovation variance theta = 0.5 # theta parameter Xt = gen_gts(n, MA1(theta = theta, sigma2 = sigma2)) plot(Xt) The use of this model is widespread, especially combined with the AR(1) model, and can be found in fields such as engineering where it is often used for signal processing. 2.3.7 Linear Drift A linear drift is a very simple deterministic time series model which can be expressed as \\[X_t = X_{t-1} + \\omega, \\] where \\(\\omega\\) is a constant and with the initial condition \\(X_0 = c\\), where \\(c\\) is an arbitrary constant (typically \\(c = 0\\)). This process can be expressed in a more familiar form as follows: \\[ {X_t} = {X_{t - 1}} + \\omega = \\left( {{X_{t - 2}} + \\omega} \\right) + \\omega = t{\\omega} + c . \\] Therefore, a (linear) drift corresponds to a simple linear model with slope \\(\\omega\\) and intercept \\(c\\). Remark 2.3 You may argue that the definition of this model is not useful since it constitutes a simple linear model. However this model is often accompanied by other time series models (such as the ones presented earlier) and its estimation can be greatly improved when considered in conjunction with the other models. Given its simple form, a linear drift can simply be generated using the code below: n = 100 # process length omega = 0.5 # slope parameter Xt = gen_gts(n, DR(omega = omega)) plot(Xt) This time series model is widely used in different areas of signal analysis where mechanical systems and measuring devices can be characterized by this type of behaviour. 2.4 Composite Stochastic Processes In the previous paragraphs we defined and briefly discussed the basic time series models that can individually be used to describe and predict a wide range of phenomena in a variety of fields of application. However, their capability of capturing and explaining the different behaviours of phenomena through time increases considerably when they are combined to form so-called composite models (or composite processes). A composite (stochastic) process can be defined as the sum of underlying (or latent) time series models and in the rest of this book we will use the term latent time series models to refer to these kinds of models. A simple example of such a model is given by \\[\\begin{aligned} Y_t &amp;= Y_{t-1} + W_t + \\delta\\\\ X_t &amp;= Y_t + Z_t, \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(W_t\\) and \\(Z_t\\) are two independent Gaussian white noise processes. This model is often used as a first basis to approximate the number of individuals in the context ecological population dynamics. For example, suppose we want to study the population of Chamois in the Swiss Alps. Let \\(Y_t\\) denote the “true” number of individuals in this population at time \\(t\\). It is reasonable to assume that the number of individuals at time \\(t\\) (\\(Y_t\\)) is (approximately) the population at the previous time \\(t-1\\) (e.g the previous year) plus a random variation and a drift. This random variation is due to the natural randomness in ecological population dynamics and reflects changes such as the number of predators, the abundance of food, or weather conditions. On the other hand, ecological drift is often of particular interest for ecologists as it can be used to determine the “long” term trends of the population (e.g. if the population is increasing, decreasing, or stable). Of course, \\(Y_t\\) (the number of individauls) is typically unknown and we observe a noisy version of it, denoted as \\(X_t\\). This process corresponds to the true population plus a measurement error since some individuals may not be observed while others may have been counted several times. Interestingly, this process can clearly be expressed as a latent time series model (or composite stochastic process) as follows: \\[\\begin{aligned} R_t &amp;= R_{t-1} + W_t \\\\ S_t &amp;= \\delta t \\\\ X_t &amp;= R_t + S_t + Z_t, \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(R_t\\), \\(S_t\\) and \\(Z_t\\) denote, respectively, a random walk, a drift, and a white noise. The code below can be used to simulate such data: n = 1000 # process length delta = 0.005 # delta parameter (drift) sigma2 = 10 # variance parameter (white noise) gamma2 = 0.1 # innovation variance (random walk) model = WN(sigma2 = sigma2) + RW(gamma2 = gamma2) + DR(omega = delta) #Xt = gen_lts(n = n, model = model) #plot(Xt) In the above graph, the first three plots represent the latent (unobserved) processes (i.e. white noise, random walk, and drift) and the last one represents the sum of the three (i.e. \\((X_t)\\)). Let us consider a real example where these latent processes are useful to describe (and predict) the behavior of economic variables such as Personal Saving Rates (PSR). A process that is used for these settings is the “random-walk-plus-noise” model, meaning that the data can be explained by a random walk process in addition to which we observe some other process (e.g. a white noise model, an autoregressive model such as an AR(1), etc.). The PSR taken from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis from January 1, 1959, to May 1, 2015, is presented in the following plot: # Load savingrt dataset data(&quot;savingrt&quot;) # Simulate based on data savingrt = gts(as.vector(savingrt), start = 1959, freq = 12, unit_ts = &quot;%&quot;, name_ts = &quot;Saving Rates&quot;, data_name = &quot;US Personal Saving Rates&quot;) # Plot savingrt simulation plot(savingrt) It can be observed that the mean of this process seems to vary over time, suggesting that a random walk can indeed be considered as a possible model to explain this data. In addition, aside from some “spikes” and occasional sudden changes, the observations appear to gradually change from one time point to the other, suggesting that some other form of dependence between them could exist.

It is also one of the first things forgotten.” – Thomas Sowell To make use of the R code within this chapter you will need to install (if not already done) and load the following libraries: quantmod; simts; astsa; robcor. In this chapter we will discuss and formalize how knowledge about \\(X_{t-1}\\) (or more generally about all the information from the past, \\(\\Omega_t\\)) can provide us with some information about the properties of \\(X_t\\). In particular, we will consider the correlation (or covariance) of \\(X_t\\) at different times such as \\(\\text{corr} \\left(X_t, X_{t+h}\\right)\\). This “form” of correlation (covariance) is called the autocorrelation (autocovariance) and is a very useful tool in time series analysis. However, if we do not assume that a time series is characterized by a certain form of “stability”, it would be rather difficult to estimate \\(\\text{corr} \\left(X_t, X_{t+h}\\right)\\) as this quantity would depend on both \\(t\\) and \\(h\\) leading to more parameters to estimate than observations available. Therefore, the concept of stationarity (which we will describe further on) is convenient in this context as it allows (among other things) to assume that \\[\\text{corr} \\left(X_t, X_{t+h}\\right) = \\text{corr} \\left(X_{t+j}, X_{t+h+j}\\right), \\;\\;\\; \\text{for all $j$},\\] implying that the autocorrelation (or autocovariance) is only a function of the lag between observations, rather than time itself. We will first discuss the concept of autocorrelation in time series, then we will discuss stationarity which will then allow us to adequately define and study estimators of the autocorrelation functions. Before moving on, it is helpful to remember that correlation (or autocorrelation) is only appropriate to measure a very specific kind of dependence, i.e. linear dependence. There are many other forms of dependence as illustrated in the bottom panels of the graph below, which all have a (true) zero correlation: Figure 3.1: Different forms of dependence and their Pearson’s r values Several other metrics have been introduced in the literature to assess the degree of “dependence” of two random variables, however this goes beyond the material discussed in this chapter. 3.1 The Autocorrelation and Autocovariance Functions We will introduce the autocorrelation function by first defining the autocovariance function. Definition 3.1 The autocovariance function of a series \\((X_t)\\) is defined as \\[{\\gamma_x}\\left( {t,t+h} \\right) \\equiv \\text{cov} \\left( {{X_t},{X_{t+h}}} \\right),\\] where the definition of covariance is given by: \\[ \\text{cov} \\left( {{X_t},{X_{t+h}}} \\right) \\equiv \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_t}{X_{t+h}}} \\right] - \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_t}} \\right]\\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_{t+h}}} \\right]. \\] Similarly, the above expectations are defined as: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_t}} \\right] &amp;\\equiv \\int\\limits_{ - \\infty }^\\infty {x \\cdot {f_t}\\left( x \\right)dx}, \\\\ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_t}{X_{t+h}}} \\right] &amp;\\equiv \\int\\limits_{ - \\infty }^\\infty {\\int\\limits_{ - \\infty }^\\infty {{x_1}{x_2} \\cdot f_{t,t+h}\\left( {{x_1},{x_2}} \\right)d{x_1}d{x_2}} } , \\end{aligned} \\] where \\({f_t}\\left( x \\right)\\) and \\(f_{t,t+h}\\left( {{x_1},{x_2}} \\right)\\) denote, respectively, the density of \\(X_t\\) and the joint density of the pair \\((X_t, X_{t+h})\\). Considering the notation used above, it should be clear that \\(X_t\\) is assumed to be a continous random variable. Since we generally consider stochastic processes with constant zero mean, we often have \\[{\\gamma_x}\\left( {t,t+h} \\right) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_t X_{t+h} \\right]. \\] In addition, in the context of this book we will normally drop the subscript referring to the time series (i.e. \\(x\\) in this case) if it is clear from the context which time series the autocovariance refers to. For example, we generally use \\({\\gamma}\\left( {t,t+h} \\right)\\) instead of \\({\\gamma_x}\\left( {t,t+h} \\right)\\). Moreover, the notation is even further simplified when the covariance of \\(X_t\\) and \\(X_{t+h}\\) is the same as that of \\(X_{t+j}\\) and \\(X_{t+h+j}\\) (for all \\(j\\)), i.e. the covariance depends only on the time between observations and not on the specific time \\(t\\). This is consequence of an important property called stationarity that was mentioned earlier and will be discussed in the next section. In this case, we simply use to following notation: \\[\\gamma \\left( {h} \\right) = \\text{cov} \\left( X_t , X_{t+h} \\right). \\] This is the definition of autocovariance that will be used from this point onwards and therefore this notation will generally be used throughout the text thereby implying certain properties for the process \\((X_t)\\) (i.e. stationarity) . With this in mind, several remarks can be made on the autocovariance function: The autocovariance function is symmetric. That is, \\({\\gamma}\\left( {h} \\right) = {\\gamma}\\left( -h \\right)\\) since \\(\\text{cov} \\left( {{X_t},{X_{t+h}}} \\right) = \\text{cov} \\left( X_{t+h},X_{t} \\right)\\). The autocovariance function “contains” the variance of the process as \\(\\text{var} \\left( X_{t} \\right) = {\\gamma}\\left( 0 \\right)\\). We have that \\(|\\gamma(h)| \\leq \\gamma(0)\\) for all \\(h\\). The proof of this inequality is direct and follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, i.e. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left(|\\gamma(h)| \\right)^2 &amp;= \\gamma(h)^2 = \\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(X_t - \\mathbb{E}[X_t] \\right)\\left(X_{t+h} - \\mathbb{E}[X_{t+h}] \\right)\\right]\\right)^2\\\\ &amp;\\leq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(X_t - \\mathbb{E}[X_t] \\right)^2 \\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(X_{t+h} - \\mathbb{E}[X_{t+h}] \\right)^2 \\right] = \\gamma(0)^2. \\end{aligned} \\] Just as any covariance, \\({\\gamma}\\left( {h} \\right)\\) is “scale dependent” since \\({\\gamma}\\left( {h} \\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), or \\(-\\infty \\le {\\gamma}\\left( {h} \\right) \\le +\\infty\\). We therefore have: if \\(\\left| {\\gamma}\\left( {h} \\right) \\right|\\) is “close” to zero, then \\(X_t\\) and \\(X_{t+h}\\) are “weakly” (linearly) dependent; if \\(\\left| {\\gamma}\\left( {h} \\right) \\right|\\) is “far” from zero, then the two random variables present a “strong” (linear) dependence. However it is generally difficult to asses what “close” and “far” from zero means in this case. \\({\\gamma}\\left( {h} \\right)=0\\) does not imply that \\(X_t\\) and \\(X_{t+h}\\) are independent but simply that they are uncorrelated. The independence is only implied by \\({\\gamma}\\left( {h} \\right)=0\\) in the jointly Gaussian case. As hinted in the introduction, an important related statistic is the correlation of \\(X_t\\) with \\(X_{t+h}\\) or autocorrelation, which is defined as \\[\\rho \\left( h \\right) = \\text{corr}\\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \\right) = \\frac{{\\text{cov}\\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \\right)}}{{{\\sigma _{{X_t}}}{\\sigma _{{X_{t + h}}}}}} = \\frac{\\gamma(h) }{\\gamma(0)}.\\] Similarly to \\(\\gamma(h)\\), it is important to note that the above notation implies that the autocorrelation function is only a function of the lag \\(h\\) between observations. Thus, autocovariances and autocorrelations are one possible way to describe the joint distribution of a time series. Indeed, the correlation of \\(X_t\\) with \\(X_{t+h}\\) is an obvious measure of how persistent a time series is. Remember that just as with any correlation: \\(\\rho \\left( h \\right)\\) is “scale free” so it is much easier to interpret than \\(\\gamma(h)\\). \\(|\\rho \\left( h \\right)| \\leq 1\\) since \\(|\\gamma(h)| \\leq \\gamma(0)\\). Causation and correlation are two very different things! 3.1.1 A Fundamental Representation Autocovariances and autocorrelations also turn out to be very useful tools as they are one of the fundamental representations of time series. Indeed, if we consider a zero mean normally distributed process, it is clear that its joint distribution is fully characterized by the autocovariances \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_t X_{t+h}]\\) (since the joint probability density only depends of these covariances). Once we know the autocovariances we know everything there is to know about the process and therefore: if two (Gaussian) processes have the same autocovariance function, then they are the same process. 3.1.2 Admissible Autocorrelation Functions 😱 Since the autocorrelation function is one of the fundamental representations of time series, it implies that one might be able to define a stochastic process by picking a set of autocorrelation values (assuming for example that \\(\\text{var}(X_t) = 1\\)). However, it turns out that not every collection of numbers, say \\(\\{\\rho_1, \\rho_2, ...\\},\\) can represent the autocorrelation of a process. Indeed, two conditions are required to ensure the validity of an autocorrelation sequence: \\(\\operatorname{max}_j \\; \\left| \\rho_j \\right| \\leq 1\\). \\(\\text{var} \\left[\\sum_{j = 0}^\\infty \\alpha_j X_{t-j} \\right] \\geq 0 \\;\\) for all \\(\\{\\alpha_0, \\alpha_1, ...\\}\\). The first condition is obvious and simply reflects the fact that \\(|\\rho \\left( h \\right)| \\leq 1\\) but the second is far more difficult to verify. To further our understanding of the latter we let \\(\\alpha_j = 0\\) for \\(j &gt; 1\\) and see that in this case the second condition implies that \\[\\text{var} \\left[ \\alpha_0 X_{t} + \\alpha_1 X_{t-1} \\right] = \\gamma_0 \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0 &amp; \\alpha_1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \\rho_1\\\\ \\rho_1 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0 \\\\ \\alpha_1 \\end{bmatrix} \\geq 0, \\] where \\(\\gamma_0\\) is a more compact notation for \\(\\gamma(0)\\). Thus, the matrix \\[ \\boldsymbol{A}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \\rho_1\\\\ \\rho_1 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\] must be positive semi-definite. Taking the determinant we have \\[\\operatorname{det} \\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_1\\right) = 1 - \\rho_1^2, \\] implying that the condition \\(|\\rho_1| \\leq 1\\) must be respected. Now, let \\(\\alpha_j = 0\\) for \\(j &gt; 2\\), then we must verify that: \\[\\text{var} \\left[ \\alpha_0 X_{t} + \\alpha_1 X_{t-1} + \\alpha_2 X_{t-2} \\right] = \\gamma_0 \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0 &amp; \\alpha_1 &amp;\\alpha_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \\rho_1 &amp; \\rho_2\\\\ \\rho_1 &amp; 1 &amp; \\rho_1 \\\\ \\rho_2 &amp; \\rho_1 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0 \\\\ \\alpha_1 \\\\ \\alpha_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\geq 0. \\] Again, this implies that the matrix \\[ \\boldsymbol{A}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \\rho_1 &amp; \\rho_2\\\\ \\rho_1 &amp; 1 &amp; \\rho_1 \\\\ \\rho_2 &amp; \\rho_1 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\] must be positive semi-definite and it is easy to verify that \\[\\operatorname{det} \\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_2\\right) = \\left(1 - \\rho_2 \\right)\\left(- 2 \\rho_1^2 + \\rho_2 + 1\\right). \\] Thus, this implies that \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;- 2 \\rho_1^2 + \\rho_2 + 1 \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow 1 \\geq \\rho_2 \\geq 2 \\rho_1^2 - 1 \\\\ &amp;\\Rightarrow 1 - \\rho_1^2 \\geq \\rho_2 - \\rho_1^2 \\geq -(1 - \\rho_1^2)\\\\ &amp;\\Rightarrow 1 \\geq \\frac{\\rho_2 - \\rho_1^2 }{1 - \\rho_1^2} \\geq -1. \\end{aligned}\\] Therefore, \\(\\rho_1\\) and \\(\\rho_2\\) must lie in a parabolic shaped region defined by the above inequalities as illustrated in Figure 3.2. Figure 3.2: Admissible autocorrelation functions From our derivation, it is clear that the restrictions on the autocorrelation are very complicated, thereby justifying the need for other forms of fundamental representation which we will explore later in this text. Before moving on to the estimation of the autocorrelation and autocovariance functions, we must first discuss the stationarity of \\((X_t)\\), which will provide a convenient framework in which \\(\\gamma(h)\\) and \\(\\rho(h)\\) can be used (rather that \\(\\gamma(t,t+h)\\) for example) and (easily) estimated. 3.2 Stationarity There are two kinds of stationarity that are commonly used. They are defined as follows: Definition 3.2 A process \\((X_t)\\) is strongly stationary or strictly stationary if the joint probability distribution of \\((X_{t-h}, ..., X_t, ..., X_{t+h})\\) is independent of \\(t\\) for all \\(t,h \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Definition 3.3 A process \\((X_t)\\) is weakly stationary, covariance stationary or second order stationary if \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_t]\\) and \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_t^2]\\) are finite and \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_t X_{t-h}]\\) depends only on \\(h\\) and not on \\(t\\) for all \\(t,h \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). These types of stationarity are not equivalent and the presence of one kind of stationarity does not imply the other. That is, a time series can be strongly stationary but not weakly stationary and vice versa. In some cases, a time series can be both strongly and weakly stationary and this occurs, for example, in the (jointly) Gaussian case. Stationarity of \\((X_t)\\) matters because it provides the framework in which averaging dependent data makes sense, thereby allowing us to easily obtain estimates for certain quantities such as autocorrelation. Several remarks and comments can be made on these definitions: As mentioned earlier, strong stationarity does not imply weak stationarity. For example, an \\(iid\\) Cauchy process is strongly but not weakly stationary (why? 🤔). Weak stationarity does not imply strong stationarity. For example, consider the following weak white noise process: \\[\\begin{equation*} X_t = \\begin{cases} U_{t} &amp; \\quad \\text{if } t \\in \\{2k:\\, k\\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}, \\\\ V_{t} &amp; \\quad \\text{if } t \\in \\{2k+1:\\, k\\in \\mathbb{Z} \\},\\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{equation*}\\] where \\({U_t} \\mathop \\sim \\limits^{iid} N\\left( {1,1} \\right)\\) and \\({V_t}\\mathop \\sim \\limits^{iid} \\mathcal{E}\\left( 1 \\right)\\) is a weakly stationary process that is not strongly stationary. Strong stationarity combined with bounded values of \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_t^2]\\) implies weak stationarity. Weak stationarity combined with normally distributed processes implies strong stationarity. Remark 3.1 (Existence of moments) It is important to note that, for a given value of \\(r\\) and a random variable \\(X\\), the expected value \\(\\mathbb{E}[X^r]\\) may be infinite, or may not exist. If there exists an \\(r \\in \\mathbb{N}^+\\) such that \\(\\mathbb{E}[|X|^r]\\) exists and is bounded, then we have that \\(\\mathbb{E}[X^j] &lt; \\infty\\) for all \\(j = 1,...,r\\). This result is implied by Jensen’s inequality. Indeed, the function \\(f(x) = x^k\\) is convex for \\(x &gt; 0\\) and \\(k &gt; 1\\), so we have \\[\\mathbb{E}\\left[|X |^j\\right]^{\\frac{r}{j}} \\leq \\mathbb{E}\\left[(|X |^j)^{\\frac{r}{j}}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[|X|^r\\right] &lt; \\infty.\\] Therefore, we obtain \\(\\mathbb{E}[X^j] \\leq \\mathbb{E}[|X|^j] &lt; \\infty\\). 3.2.1 Assessing Weak Stationarity of Time Series Models It is important to understand how to verify if a postulated model is (weakly) stationary. In order to do so, we must ensure that our model satisfies the following three properties: \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_t \\right] = \\mu_t = \\mu &lt; \\infty\\), \\(\\text{var}\\left[X_t \\right] = \\sigma^2_t = \\sigma^2 &lt; \\infty\\), \\(\\text{cov}\\left(X_t, X_{t+h} \\right) = \\gamma \\left(h\\right)\\) (i.e. the autocovariance only depends on \\(h\\) and not on \\(t\\)). In the following examples, we evaluate the stationarity of the processes introduced in Section 2.3. Example 3.1 (Gaussian White Noise) It is easy to verify that this process is stationary. Indeed, we have: \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_t}} \\right] = 0\\), \\(\\gamma(0) = \\sigma^2 &lt; \\infty\\), \\(\\gamma(h) = 0\\) for \\(|h| &gt; 0\\). Example 3.2 (Random Walk) To evaluate the stationarity of this process, we first derive its properties: We begin by calculating the expectation of the process: \\[ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_t}} \\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_{t - 1}} + {W_t}} \\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} + {X_0}} \\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} } \\right] + {c} = c. \\] Observe that the mean obtained is constant since it depends only on the value of the first term in the sequence. Next, after finding the mean to be constant, we calculate the variance to check stationarity: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{var}\\left( {{X_t}} \\right) &amp;= \\text{var}\\left( {\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_t}} + {X_0}} \\right) = \\text{var}\\left( {\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} } \\right) + \\underbrace {\\text{var}\\left( {{X_0}} \\right)}_{= 0} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^t {\\text{var}\\left( {{W_i}} \\right)} = t \\sigma_w^2, \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\sigma_w^2 = \\text{var}(W_t)\\). Therefore, the variance depends on time \\(t\\), contradicting our second property. Moreover, we have: \\[\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{t \\to \\infty } \\; \\text{var}\\left(X_t\\right) = \\infty.\\] This process is therefore not weakly stationary. Regarding the autocovariance of a random walk, we have: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\gamma \\left( h \\right) &amp;= \\text{cov}\\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \\right) = \\text{cov}\\left( {\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} ,\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{t + h} {{W_j}} } \\right) = \\text{cov}\\left( {\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^t {{W_i}} ,\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^t {{W_j}} } \\right)\\\\ &amp;= \\min \\left( {t,t + h} \\right)\\sigma _w^2 = \\left( {t + \\min \\left( {0,h} \\right)} \\right)\\sigma _w^2, \\end{aligned} \\] which further illustrates the non-stationarity of this process. Moreover, the autocorrelation of this process is given by \\[\\rho (h) = \\frac{t + \\min \\left( {0,h} \\right)}{\\sqrt{t}\\sqrt{t+h}},\\] implying (for a fixed \\(h\\)) that \\[\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{t \\to \\infty } \\; \\rho(h) = 1.\\] Note that using \\(\\gamma (h)\\) and \\(\\rho (h)\\) in this context is actually an abuse of notation since both of these quantites are a function of \\(h\\) and \\(t\\) for a random walk process. In the following simulated example, we illustrate the non-stationary feature of such a process: # Number of simulated processes B = 200 # Length of random walks n = 1000 # Output matrix out = matrix(NA,B,n) # Set seed for reproducibility set.seed(6182) # Simulate Data for (i in seq_len(B)){ # Simulate random walk Xt = gen_gts(n, RW(gamma = 1)) # Store process out[i,] = Xt } # Plot random walks plot(NA, xlim = c(1,n), ylim = range(out), xlab = &quot;Time&quot;, ylab = &quot; &quot;) grid() color = sample(topo.colors(B, alpha = 0.5)) grid() for (i in seq_len(B)){ lines(out[i,], col = color[i]) } # Add 95% confidence region lines(1:n, 1.96*sqrt(1:n), col = 2, lwd = 2, lty = 2) lines(1:n, -1.96*sqrt(1:n), col = 2, lwd = 2, lty = 2) Figure 3.3: Two hundred simulated random walks. In the plot above, two hundred simulated random walks are plotted along with theoretical 95% confidence intervals (red-dashed lines). The relationship between time and variance can clearly be observed (i.e. the variance of the process increases with the time). Example 3.3 (Moving Average of Order 1) Similarly to our previous examples, we attempt to verify the stationary properties for the MA(1) model defined in the previous chapter: \\[ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_t}} \\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{\\theta_1}{W_{t - 1}} + {W_t}} \\right] = {\\theta_1} \\mathbb{E} \\left[ {{W_{t - 1}}} \\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{W_t}} \\right] = 0. \\] \\[\\text{var} \\left( {{X_t}} \\right) = \\theta_1^2 \\text{var} \\left( W_{t - 1}\\right) + \\text{var} \\left( W_{t}\\right) = \\left(1 + \\theta^2 \\right) \\sigma^2_w.\\] Regarding the autocovariance, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{cov}\\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \\right) &amp;= \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {\\left( {{X_t} - \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_t}} \\right]} \\right)\\left( {{X_{t + h}} - \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_{t + h}}} \\right]} \\right)} \\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_t}{X_{t + h}}} \\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {\\left( {{\\theta}{W_{t - 1}} + {W_t}} \\right)\\left( {{\\theta }{W_{t + h - 1}} + {W_{t + h}}} \\right)} \\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {\\theta^2{W_{t - 1}}{W_{t + h - 1}} + \\theta {W_t}{W_{t + h}} + {\\theta}{W_{t - 1}}{W_{t + h}} + {W_t}{W_{t + h}}} \\right]. \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] It is easy to see that \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{W_t}{W_{t + h}}} \\right] = {\\boldsymbol{1}_{\\left\\{ {h = 0} \\right\\}}}\\sigma _w^2\\) and therefore, we obtain \\[\\text{cov} \\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \\right) = \\left( {\\theta^2{ \\boldsymbol{1}_{\\left\\{ {h = 0} \\right\\}}} + {\\theta}{\\boldsymbol{1}_{\\left\\{ {h = 1} \\right\\}}} + {\\theta}{\\boldsymbol{1}_{\\left\\{ {h = - 1} \\right\\}}} + {\\boldsymbol{1}_{\\left\\{ {h = 0} \\right\\}}}} \\right)\\sigma _w^2\\] implying the following autocovariance function: \\[\\gamma \\left( h \\right) = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\\left( {\\theta^2 + 1} \\right)\\sigma _w^2}&amp;{h = 0} \\\\ {{\\theta}\\sigma _w^2}&amp;{\\left| h \\right| = 1} \\\\ 0&amp;{\\left| h \\right| &gt; 1} \\end{array}} \\right. .\\] Therefore, an MA(1) process is weakly stationary since both the mean and variance are constant over time and its covariance function is only a function of the lag \\((h)\\). Finally, we can easily obtain the autocorrelation for this process, which is given by \\[\\rho \\left( h \\right) = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 1&amp;{h = 0} \\\\ {\\frac{{{\\theta}\\sigma _w^2}}{{\\left( {\\theta^2 + 1} \\right)\\sigma _w^2}} = \\frac{{{\\theta}}}{{\\theta^2 + 1}}}&amp;{\\left| h \\right| = 1} \\\\ 0&amp;{\\left| h \\right| &gt; 1} \\end{array}} \\right. .\\] Interestingly, we can note that \\(|\\rho(1)| \\leq 0.5\\). Example 3.4 (Autoregressive of Order 1) As another example, we shall verify the stationary properties for the AR(1) model defined in the previous chapter. Using the backsubstitution technique, we can rearrange an AR(1) process so that it is written in a more compact form, i.e. \\[\\begin{aligned} {X_t} &amp; = {\\phi }{X_{t - 1}} + {W_t} = \\phi \\left[ {\\phi {X_{t - 2}} + {W_{t - 1}}} \\right] + {W_t} = {\\phi ^2}{X_{t - 2}} + \\phi {W_{t - 1}} + {W_t} \\\\ &amp; \\vdots \\\\ &amp; = {\\phi ^k}{X_{t-k}} + \\sum\\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} {{\\phi ^j}{W_{t - j}}} . \\end{aligned} \\] By taking the limit in \\(k\\) (which is perfectly valid as we assume \\(t \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\)) and assuming \\(|\\phi|&lt;1\\), we obtain \\[\\begin{aligned} X_t = \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{k \\to \\infty} \\; {X_t} = \\sum\\limits_{j = 0}^{\\infty} {{\\phi ^j}{W_{t - j}}} \\end{aligned} \\] and therefore such a process can be interpreted as a linear combination of white noise \\((W_t)\\) and corresponds (as we will observe later on) to an MA(\\(\\infty\\)). In addition, the requirement \\(\\left| \\phi \\right| &lt; 1\\) turns out to be extremely useful as the above formula is related to a geometric series which would diverge if \\(\\phi \\geq 1\\) (for example when \\(\\phi = 1\\) we have a random walk). Indeed, remember that an infinite (converging) geometric series is given by \\[\\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^\\infty \\, a{{r^k}} = \\frac{a}{{1 - r}}, \\; {\\text{ if }}\\left| r \\right| &lt; 1.\\] The origin of this requirement comes from needing to ensure that the characteristic polynomial solution for an AR(1) lies outside the unit circle thereby ensuring that the process is stationary. Indeed, if \\(\\phi \\ge 1\\), the process would not converge. With this setup, we demonstrate how crucial this property is by calculating each of the requirements of a stationary process. First, we will check if the mean is stationary. In this case, we choose to use limits in order to derive the expectation \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{X_t}} \\right] &amp;= \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{k \\to \\infty } \\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{\\phi^k}{X_{t-k}} + \\sum\\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} {\\phi^j{W_{t - j}}} } \\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{k \\to \\infty } \\, \\underbrace {{\\phi ^k}{\\mathbb{E}[X_{t-k}]}}_{= 0} + \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{k \\to \\infty } \\, \\sum\\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} {\\phi^j\\underbrace {\\mathbb{E}\\left[ {{W_{t - j}}} \\right]}_{ = 0}} = 0. \\end{aligned} \\] As expected, the mean is zero and, hence, the first criterion for weak stationarity is satisfied. Next, we determine the variance of the process \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{var}\\left( {{X_t}} \\right) &amp;= \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{k \\to \\infty } \\text{var}\\left( {{\\phi^k}{X_{t-k}} + \\sum\\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} {\\phi^j{W_{t - j}}} } \\right) = \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{k \\to \\infty } \\sum\\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} {\\phi ^{2j} \\text{var}\\left( {{W_{t - j}}} \\right)} \\\\ &amp;= \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{k \\to \\infty } \\sum\\limits_{j = 0}^{k - 1} \\sigma _W^2 \\, {\\phi ^{2j}} = \\underbrace {\\frac{\\sigma _W^2}{{1 - {\\phi ^2}}}.}_{\\begin{subarray}{l} {\\text{Geom. Series}} \\end{subarray}} \\end{aligned} \\] Once again, the above result only holds because we are able to use the convergence of the geometric series as a result of \\(\\left| \\phi \\right| &lt; 1\\). Finally, we consider the autocovariance of an AR(1). For \\(h &gt; 0\\), we have \\[\\gamma \\left( h \\right) = \\text{cov}\\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h}}} \\right) = \\phi \\text{cov}\\left( {{X_t},{X_{t + h - 1}}} \\right) = \\phi \\, \\gamma \\left( h-1 \\right).\\] Therefore, using the symmetry of autocovariance, we find that \\[\\gamma \\left( h \\right) = \\phi^{|h|} \\, \\gamma(0).\\] Both the mean and variance do not depend on time. In addition, the autocovariance function can be viewed as a function that only depends on the time lag \\(h\\) and, thus, the AR(1) process is weakly stationary if \\(\\left| \\phi \\right| &lt; 1\\). Lastly, we can obtain the autocorrelation for this process. Indeed, for \\(h &gt; 0\\), we have \\[\\rho \\left( h \\right) = \\frac{{\\gamma \\left( h \\right)}}{{\\gamma \\left( 0 \\right)}} = \\frac{{\\phi \\gamma \\left( {h - 1} \\right)}}{{\\gamma \\left( 0 \\right)}} = \\phi \\rho \\left( {h - 1} \\right).\\] After simplifying, we obtain \\[\\rho \\left( h \\right) = {\\phi^{|h|}}.\\] Thus, the autocorrelation function for an AR(1) exhibits a geometric decay, meaning that as \\(|\\phi|\\) gets smaller the autocorrelation reaches zero at a faster rate (on the contrary, if \\(|\\phi|\\) is close to 1 then the decay rate is slower). This is well illustrated in the following plots. Figure 3.4: Comparison of theoretical ACF of AR(1) with different values of phi (i.e. phi = 0.9, 0.5, 0.1) 3.3 Estimation of Moments (Stationary Processes) In this section, we discuss how moments and related quantities of stationary processes can be estimated. Informally speaking, the use of “averages” is meaningful for such processes suggesting that classical moments estimators can be employed. Indeed, suppose that one is interested in estimating \\(\\alpha \\equiv \\mathbb{E}[m (X_t)]\\), where \\(m(\\cdot)\\) is a known function of \\(X_t\\). If \\(X_t\\) is a strongly stationary process, we have \\[\\alpha = \\int m(x) \\, f(x) dx\\] where \\(f(x)\\) denotes the density of \\(X_t, \\; \\forall t\\). Replacing \\(f(x)\\) by \\(f_n(x)\\), the empirical density, we obtain the following estimator \\[\\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n m\\left(x_i\\right).\\] In the next subsection, we examine how this simple idea can be used to estimate the mean, autocovariance and autocorrelation functions. Moreover, we discuss some of the properties of these estimators. 3.3.1 Estimation of the Mean Function If a time series is stationary, the mean function is constant and a possible estimator of this quantity is, as discussed above, given by \\[\\bar{X} = {\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t}} }.\\] Naturally, the \\(k\\)-th moment, say \\(\\beta_k \\equiv \\mathbb{E}[X_t^k]\\) can be estimated by \\[\\hat{\\beta}_k = {\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t^k}} }, \\;\\; k \\in \\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\, 0 &lt; x &lt; \\infty \\right\\}.\\] The variance of such an estimator can be derived as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\text{var} \\left( \\hat{\\beta}_k \\right) &amp;= \\text{var} \\left( {\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t^k}} } \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{{{n^2}}}\\text{var} \\left( {{{\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 1&amp; \\cdots &amp;1 \\end{array}} \\right]}_{1 \\times n}}{{\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{X_1^k}} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {{X_n^k}} \\end{array}} \\right]}_{n \\times 1}}} \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{{{n^2}}}{\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 1&amp; \\cdots &amp;1 \\end{array}} \\right]_{1 \\times n}} \\, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}(k) \\, {\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 \\end{array}} \\right]_{n \\times 1}}, \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}(k) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}\\) and its \\(i\\)-th, \\(j\\)-th element is given by \\[ \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}(k)\\right)_{i,j} = \\text{cov} \\left(X_i^k, X_j^k\\right).\\] In the case \\(k = 1\\), (3.1) can easily be further simplified. Indeed, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{var} \\left( {\\bar X} \\right) &amp;= \\text{var} \\left( {\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t = 1}^n {{X_t}} } \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{{{n^2}}}{\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 1&amp; \\cdots &amp;1 \\end{array}} \\right]_{1 \\times n}}\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\\gamma \\left( 0 \\right)}&amp;{\\gamma \\left( 1 \\right)}&amp; \\cdots &amp;{\\gamma \\left( {n - 1} \\right)} \\\\ {\\gamma \\left( 1 \\right)}&amp;{\\gamma \\left( 0 \\right)}&amp;{}&amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\vdots &amp;{}&amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ {\\gamma \\left( {n - 1} \\right)}&amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdots &amp;{\\gamma \\left( 0 \\right)} \\end{array}} \\right]_{n \\times n}{\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 \\end{array}} \\right]_{n \\times 1}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{{{n^2}}}\\left( {n\\gamma \\left( 0 \\right) + 2\\left( {n - 1} \\right)\\gamma \\left( 1 \\right) + 2\\left( {n - 2} \\right)\\gamma \\left( 2 \\right) + \\cdots + 2\\gamma \\left( {n - 1} \\right)} \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{h = - n}^n {\\left( {1 - \\frac{{\\left| h \\right|}}{n}} \\right)\\gamma \\left( h \\right)} . \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Obviously, when \\(X_t\\) is a white noise process, the above formula reduces to the usual \\(\\text{var} \\left( {\\bar X} \\right) = \\sigma^2_w/n\\). In the following example, we consider the case of an AR(1) process and discuss how \\(\\text{var} \\left( {\\bar X} \\right)\\) can be obtained or estimated. Example 3.5 For an AR(1), we have \\(\\gamma(h) = \\phi^h \\sigma_w^2 \\left(1 - \\phi^2\\right)^{-1}\\). Therefore, we obtain (after some computations): \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{var} \\left( {\\bar X} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_w^2 \\left( n - 2\\phi - n \\phi^2 + 2 \\phi^{n + 1}\\right)}{n^2\\left(1-\\phi^2\\right)\\left(1-\\phi\\right)^2}. \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] Unfortunately, deriving such an exact formula is often difficult when considering more complex models. However, asymptotic approximations are often employed to simplify the calculation. For example, in our case we have \\[\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } \\; n \\text{var} \\left( {\\bar X} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_w^2}{\\left(1-\\phi\\right)^2},\\] providing the following approximate formula: \\[\\text{var} \\left( {\\bar X} \\right) \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_w^2}{n \\left(1-\\phi\\right)^2}.\\] Alternatively, simulation methods can also be employed. For example, a possible strategy would be parametric bootstrap. Example 3.6 Parametric bootstrap can be implemented in the following manner: Simulate a new sample under the postulated model, i.e. \\(X_t^* \\sim F_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\) (note: if \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) is unknown it can be replaced by \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\), a suitable estimator). Compute the statistics of interest on the simulated sample \\((X_t^*)\\). Repeat Steps 1 and 2 \\(B\\) times where \\(B\\) is sufficiently “large” (typically \\(100 \\leq B \\leq 10000\\)). Compute the empirical variance of the statistics of interest based on the \\(B\\) independent replications. In our example, we would consider \\((X_t^*)\\) to be \\({\\bar{X}^*}\\) and seek to obtain: \\[\\hat{\\sigma}^2_B = \\frac{1}{B-1} \\sum_{i = 1}^B \\left(\\bar{X}^*_i - \\bar{X}^* \\right)^2, \\;\\;\\; \\text{where} \\;\\;\\; \\bar{X}^* = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{i=1}^B \\bar{X}^*_i,\\] where \\(\\bar{X}^*_i\\) denotes the value of the mean estimated on the \\(i\\)-th simulated sample. The figure below generated by the following code compares these three methods for \\(n = 10\\), \\(B = 1000,\\) \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\) and a grid of values for \\(\\phi\\) going from \\(-0.95\\) to \\(0.95\\): # Define sample size n = 10 # Number of Monte-Carlo replications B = 5000 # Define grid of values for phi phi = seq(from = 0.95, to = -0.95, length.out = 30) # Define result matrix result = matrix(NA,B,length(phi)) # Start simulation for (i in seq_along(phi)){ # Define model model = AR1(phi = phi[i], sigma2 = 1) # Monte-Carlo for (j in seq_len(B)){ # Simulate AR(1) Xt = gen_gts(n, model) # Estimate Xbar result[j,i] = mean(Xt) } } # Estimate variance of Xbar var.Xbar = apply(result,2,var) # Compute theoretical variance var.theo = (n - 2*phi - n*phi^2 + 2*phi^(n+1))/(n^2*(1-phi^2)*(1-phi)^2) # Compute (approximate) variance var.approx = 1/(n*(1-phi)^2) # Compare variance estimations plot(NA, xlim = c(-1,1), ylim = range(var.approx), log = &quot;y&quot;, ylab = expression(paste(&quot;var(&quot;, bar(X), &quot;)&quot;)), xlab= expression(phi), cex.lab = 1) grid() lines(phi,var.theo, col = &quot;deepskyblue4&quot;) lines(phi, var.Xbar, col = &quot;firebrick3&quot;) lines(phi,var.approx, col = &quot;springgreen4&quot;) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;,c(&quot;Theoretical variance&quot;,&quot;Bootstrap variance&quot;,&quot;Approximate variance&quot;), col = c(&quot;deepskyblue4&quot;,&quot;firebrick3&quot;,&quot;springgreen4&quot;), lty = 1, bty = &quot;n&quot;,bg = &quot;white&quot;, box.col = &quot;white&quot;, cex = 1.2) It can be observed that the variance of \\(\\bar{X}\\) typically increases with \\(\\phi\\). As expected when \\(\\phi = 0\\), we have \\(\\text{var}(\\bar{X}) = 1/n\\) and in this case the process is a white noise. Moreover, the bootstrap approach appears to well approximate the curve of (3.2), while the asymptotic form provides a reasonable approximation when \\(\\phi\\) lies between -0.5 and 0.5. Naturally, the quality of this approximation would be far better for a larger sample size (here we consider \\(n = 10\\), which is a little “extreme”). 3.3.2 Sample Autocovariance and Autocorrelation Functions A natural estimator of the autocovariance function is given by: \\[\\hat \\gamma \\left( h \\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t = 1}^{n - h} {\\left( {{X_t} - \\bar X} \\right)\\left( {{X_{t + h}} - \\bar X} \\right)} \\] leading to the following “plug-in” estimator of the autocorrelation function: \\[\\hat \\rho \\left( h \\right) = \\frac{{\\hat \\gamma \\left( h \\right)}}{{\\hat \\gamma \\left( 0 \\right)}}.\\] A graphical representation of the autocorrelation function is often the first step for any time series analysis (again assuming the process to be stationary). Consider the following simulated example: # Set seed for reproducibility set.seed(2241) # Simulate 100 observation from a Gaussian white noise Xt = gen_gts(100, WN(sigma2 = 1)) # Compute autocorrelation acf_Xt = simts::ACF(Xt) # Plot autocorrelation plot(acf_Xt, show.ci = FALSE) In this example, the true autocorrelation is equal to zero at any lag \\(h \\neq 0\\), but obviously the estimated autocorrelations are random variables and are not equal to their true values. It would therefore be useful to have some knowledge about the variability of the sample autocorrelations (under some conditions) to assess whether the data comes from a completely random series or presents some significant correlation at certain lags. The following result provides an asymptotic solution to this problem: Theorem 3.1 If \\(X_t\\) is a strong white noise with finite fourth moment, then \\(\\hat{\\rho}(h)\\) is approximately normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(n^{-1}\\) for all fixed \\(h\\). The proof of this Theorem is given in Appendix A. Using this result, we now have an approximate method to assess whether peaks in the sample autocorrelation are significant by determining whether the observed peak lies outside the interval \\(\\pm 2/\\sqrt{n}\\) (i.e. an approximate 95% confidence interval). Returning to our previous example and adding confidence bands to the previous graph, we obtain: # Plot autocorrelation with confidence bands plot(acf_Xt) It can now be observed that most peaks lie within the interval \\(\\pm 2/\\sqrt{n}\\) suggesting that the true data generating process is uncorrelated. Example 3.7 To illustrate how the autocorrelation function can be used to reveal some “features” of a time series, we download the level of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index, often abbreviated as the S&amp;P 500. This financial index is based on the market capitalization of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. The graph below shows the index level and daily returns from 1990. # Load package library(quantmod) # Download S&amp;P index getSymbols(&quot;^GSPC&quot;, from=&quot;1990-01-01&quot;, to = Sys.Date()) ## [1] &quot;GSPC&quot; # Extract index level and daily returns from the data GSPC_index = gts(data = as.numeric(GSPC$GSPC.Close), start = 1990, freq = 252, Time = time(GSPC), unit_time = &quot;year&quot;, name_ts = &quot;Index Level&quot;, data_name = paste(&quot;S&amp;P 500 (1990-01-01 - &quot;,Sys.Date(),&quot;)&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;) ) GSPC_returns = gts(data = as.numeric(ClCl(GSPC)), start = 1990, freq = 252, Time = time(GSPC), unit_time = &quot;year&quot;, name_ts = &quot;Daily Returns&quot;, data_name = paste(&quot;S&amp;P 500 (1990-01-01 - &quot;,Sys.Date(),&quot;)&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;) ) par(mfrow = c(1,2)) plot(GSPC_index) plot(GSPC_returns) From these graphs, it is clear that the returns are not identically distributed as the variance seems to change over time and clusters with either high or low volatility can be observed. These characteristics of financial time series are well known and further on in this book we will discuss how the variance of such processes can be approximated. Nevertheless, we compute the empirical autocorrelation function of the S&amp;P 500 return to evaluate the degree of “linear” dependence between observations. The graph below presents the empirical autocorrelation. sp500 = na.omit(GSPC_returns) names(sp500) = paste(&quot;S&amp;P 500 (1990-01-01 - &quot;,Sys.Date(),&quot;)&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;) plot(simts::ACF(sp500)) As expected, the autocorrelation is small but it might be reasonable to believe that this sequence is not purely uncorrelated. Unfortunately, Theorem 3.1 is based on an asymptotic argument and since the confidence bands constructed are also asymptotic, there are no “exact” tools that can be used in this case. To study the validity of these results when \\(n\\) is “small” we can perform a simulation study. In the latter, we simulate processes from a Gaussian white noise and examine the empirical distribution of \\(\\hat{\\rho}(3)\\) with different sample sizes (i.e. \\(n\\) is set to 5, 10, 30 and 300). Intuitively, the “quality” of the approximation provided by Theorem 3.1 should increase with the sample size \\(n\\). The code below performs such a simulation and compares the empirical distribution of \\(\\sqrt{n} \\hat{\\rho}(3)\\) with a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 (its asymptotic distribution), which is depicted using a red line. # Number of Monte Carlo replications B = 10000 # Define considered lag h = 3 # Sample size considered N = c(5, 10, 30, 300) # Initialisation result = matrix(NA,B,length(N)) # Set seed set.seed(1) # Start Monte Carlo for (i in seq_len(B)){ for (j in seq_along(N)){ # Simluate process Xt = rnorm(N[j]) # Save autocorrelation at lag h result[i,j] = acf(Xt, plot = FALSE)$acf[h+1] } } # Plot results par(mfrow = c(2,length(N)/2)) for (i in seq_along(N)){ # Estimated empirical distribution hist(sqrt(N[i])*result[,i], col = &quot;royalblue1&quot;, main = paste(&quot;Sample size n =&quot;,N[i]), probability = TRUE, xlim = c(-4,4), xlab = &quot; &quot;) # Asymptotic distribution xx = seq(from = -10, to = 10, length.out = 10^3) yy = dnorm(xx,0,1) lines(xx,yy, col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 2) } As expected, it can clearly be observed that the asymptotic approximation is quite poor when \\(n = 5\\) but as the sample size increases the approximation improves and is very close when, for example, \\(n = 300\\). Therefore, this simulation would suggest that Theorem 3.1 provides a relatively “close” approximation of the distribution of \\(\\hat{\\rho}(h)\\), especially when the sample size is large enough. 3.3.3 Robustness Issues The data generating process delivers a theoretical autocorrelation (autocovariance) function that, as explained in the previous section, can then be estimated through the sample autocorrelation (autocovariance) functions. However, in practice, the sample is often issued from a data generating process that is “close” to the true one, meaning that the sample suffers from some form of small contamination. This contamination is typically represented by a small amount of extreme observations that are called “outliers” that come from a process that is different from the true data generating process. The fact that the sample can suffer from outliers implies that the standard estimation of the autocorrelation (autocovariance) functions through the sample functions could be highly biased. The standard estimators presented in the previous section are therefore not “robust” and can behave badly when the sample suffers from contamination. To illustrate this limitation for a classical estimator, we consider the following two processes: \\[ \\begin{aligned} X_t &amp;= \\phi X_{t-1} + W_t, \\;\\;\\; W_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_w^2),\\\\ Y_t &amp;= \\begin{cases} X_t &amp; \\quad \\text{with probability } 1 - \\epsilon\\\\ U_t &amp; \\quad \\text{with probability } \\epsilon\\\\ \\end{cases}, \\;\\;\\; U_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_u^2), \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(\\epsilon\\) is “small” and \\(\\sigma_u^2 \\gg \\sigma_w^2\\). The process \\((Y_t)\\) can be interpreted as a “contaminated” version of \\((X_t)\\) and the figure below represents one realization of the process \\((Y_t)\\) using the following setting: \\(n = 100\\), \\(\\sigma_u^2 = 10\\), \\(\\phi = 0.9\\), \\(\\sigma_w^2 = 1\\) as well as \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). # Set seed for reproducibility set.seed(2241) # Define length of time series N = 100 # Select observations from contamination distribution epsilon = 0.05 index = sample(1:N, round(epsilon*N)) Ut = gen_gts(N, WN(sigma2 = 10)) # Simulate observations from Xt and Yt Xt = gen_gts(N, AR1(phi = 0.9, sigma2 = 1)) Yt = Xt Yt[index] = Ut[index] # Plot time series par(mfrow = c(1,1)) plot(Yt, main = &quot;Contaminated Time Series Yt&quot;) The first question we can ask ourselves looking at this figure is: where are the outliers? 🤔 You can probably spot a few but there are 5 outliers. If you’re having difficulties detecting the outliers don’t worry: it’s a commonly known phenomenon in time series that detecting outliers is not always easy. Indeed, when looking at a time series for the first time it’s not straightforward to understand if there’s any form of contamination. Let’s now compare \\((X_t)\\) and \\((Y_t)\\) in the following plots. # Plot time series par(mfrow = c(2,1)) plot(Xt, main = &quot;Original Time Series Xt&quot;) plot(Yt, main = &quot;Contaminated Time Series Yt&quot;) points(index-1, Yt[index], col = &quot;red&quot;) In this case it’s more simple to detect the outliers (that are also highlighted with the red dots) since we can compare \\((Y_t)\\) with the original uncontaminated time series \\((X_t)\\). Having highlighted how exploratory analysis can provide limited information on the presence of contamination in an observed time series, we now consider a simulated example to highlight how the performance of a “classical” autocorrelation estimator can deteriorate if the sample is contaminated ( i.e. what is the impact of \\((Y_t)\\) on the ACF estimator \\(\\hat{\\rho}(h)\\)). In this simulation, we will use the setting presented above and consider \\(B = 10^3\\) bootstrap replications comparing the performance of the classical estimator when applied to an uncontaminated time series \\((X_t)\\) and a contaminated time series \\((Y_t)\\). B = 1000 # Number of simulations N = 100 # Length of time series epsilon = 0.05 # Amount of contamination phi = 0.9 # AR(1) parameter value # Store first 15 values of Empirical ACF (for Xt and Yt) acf_xt = acf_yt = matrix(NA, B, 15) for(i in 1:B) { # Set seed for reproducibility set.seed(i + 2241) # Select observations from contamination distribution index = sample(1:N, round(epsilon*N)) Ut = gen_gts(N, WN(sigma2 = 10)) # Simulate observations from Xt and Yt Xt = gen_gts(N, AR1(phi = 0.9, sigma2 = 1)) Yt = Xt Yt[index] = Ut[index] # Store ACF values acf_xt[i, ] = as.numeric(simts::ACF(Xt))[1:15] acf_yt[i, ] = as.numeric(simts::ACF(Yt))[1:15] } # Compute the Theoretical ACF of an AR(1) model (up to lag 15) true_acf = phi^(1:15) # Make boxplots of Empirical ACF for both settings and compare with true ACF par(mfrow = c(1,2)) boxplot(acf_xt[, 3], col = &quot;grey80&quot;, main = &quot;ACF at lag 3 (uncontaminated)&quot;) abline(h = true_acf[3], col = &quot;red&quot;) boxplot(acf_yt[, 3], col = &quot;grey80&quot;, main = &quot;ACF at lag 3 (contaminated)&quot;) abline(h = true_acf[3], col = &quot;red&quot;) The boxplots represent the empirical distribution of the ACF estimator \\(\\hat{\\rho}(3)\\): the left boxplot shows how the standard autocorrelation estimator is centered around the true value (red line) when the sample is not contaminated while the right boxplot shows how this estimate is considerably biased when the sample is contaminated. Indeed, it can be seen how the boxplot under contamination shows a lower value of autocorrelation indicating that it does not detect much dependence in the data although it should. The latter phenomenon is even more evident when analysing the empirical distributions at the larger lags. This is a known result in robustness, more specifically that outliers in the data can break the dependence structure and make it more difficult for the latter to be detected. In order to limit this problem, different robust estimators exist for time series problems which are designed to reduce the impact of contamination on the estimation procedure. Among these estimators, there are a few that estimate the autocorrelation (autocovariance) functions in a robust manner. One of these estimators is provided in the robacf() function in the “robcor” package. The following simulated example shows how it limits the bias which is induced on the classic estimator \\(\\hat{\\rho}(h)\\) from contamination. Unlike the previous simulation, we shall only consider data issued from the contaminated process \\((Y_t)\\), and compare the performance of two estimators (i.e. classical and robust autocorrelation estimators): B = 1000 # Number of simulations N = 100 # Length of time series epsilon = 0.05 # Amount of contamination phi = 0.9 # AR(1) parameter value # Store first 15 values of Empirical ACF (classic and robust) cl_acf = rob_acf = matrix(NA, B, 15) for(i in 1:B) { # Set seed for reproducibility set.seed(i + 2241) # Select observations from contamination distribution index = sample(1:N, round(epsilon*N)) Ut = gen_gts(N, WN(sigma2 = 10)) # Simulate observations from Yt Yt = gen_gts(N, AR1(phi = 0.9, sigma2 = 1)) Yt[index] = Ut[index] # Store Classic and Robust ACF values cl_acf[i, ] = as.numeric(simts::ACF(Yt))[1:15] rob_acf[i, ] = robacf(Yt, plot = FALSE)$acf[1:15] } # Compute the Theoretical ACF of an AR(1) model (up to lag 15) true_acf = phi^(1:15) # Make boxplots of both Classic and Robust Empirical ACF and compare with true ACF par(mfrow = c(1,2)) boxplot(cl_acf[, 2], col = &quot;grey80&quot;, main = &quot;Classic ACF at lag 2&quot;) abline(h = true_acf[2], col = &quot;red&quot;) boxplot(rob_acf[, 2], col = &quot;grey80&quot;, main = &quot;Robust ACF at lag 2&quot;) abline(h = true_acf[2], col = &quot;red&quot;) In this case we see the empirical distributions of the two estimators (classic and robust) for the ACF at time-lag \\(h = 2\\). As you can see, the robust estimator remains close to the true value represented by the red line in the boxplots as opposed to the standard estimator. However, the price to pay in terms of bias reduction is a loss of efficiency of the robust estimator. Indeed it can often be observed that to reduce the bias induced by contamination in the sample, robust estimators pay a certain price in terms of efficiency. To assess how much is “lost” by the robust estimator compared to the classical one in terms of efficiency, we consider one last simulation where we examine the performance of two estimators on data issued from the uncontaminated process, i.e. \\((X_t)\\). Therefore, the only difference between this simulation and the previous one is the value of \\(\\epsilon\\) set equal to \\(0\\) (the code shall thus be omitted). For this reason we simply show a plot that represents the ratio of the variances of the classic and robust ACF estimators respectively. If they happened to have the same efficiency, we would expect this ratio to be roughly equal to 1 over all the considered lags (we omit this ratio at lag 1 since it is numerically impossible to represent due to the infinitesimal size of the empirical variances). As can be seen on the plot, the black line representing the above described ratio decreases steadily as the lags increase and moves further away from the red dotted line representing equality of variances. Hence, since the variance of the classic ACF estimator is in the numerator of this ratio, we can conclude that the variance of the robust ACF estimator is always larger and increases over the lags. This can partly be explained by the fact that the classic ACF estimator \\(\\hat{\\rho}(h)\\) makes use of all the observations while the robust estimator only uses part of the information coming from more “extreme” observations. Moreover, the number of observations available to estimate the greater lags is smaller and therefore the robust ACF estimator pays a larger price in terms of “loss” of information. A general overview of the concepts and advantages of robustness can be found in Appendix B. "],

This class is represented by the Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models which, among others, combine and include the autoregressive and moving average models seen in the previous chapter. To introduce this class of models, we start by describing a sub-class called AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models which represent the backbone on which the SARIMA class is built. The importance of ARMA models resides in their flexibility as well as their capacity of describing (or closely approximating) almost all the features of a stationary time series. The autoregressive parts of these models describe how consecutive observations in time influence each other while the moving average parts capture some possible unobserved shocks thereby allowing to model different phenomena which can be observed in various fields going from biology to finance. With this premise, the first part of this chapter introduces and explains the class of ARMA models in the following manner. First of all we will discuss the class of linear processes, which ARMA models belong to, and we will then proceed to a detailed description of autoregressive models in which we review their definition, explain their properties, introduce the main estimation methods for their parameters and highlight the diagnostic tools which can help understand if the estimated models appear to be appropriate or sufficient to well describe the observed time series. Once this is done, we will then use most of the results given for the autoregressive models to further describe and discuss moving average models, for which we underline the property of invertibility, and finally the ARMA models. Indeed, the properties and estimation methods for the latter class are directly inherited from the discussions on the autoregressive and moving average models. The second part of this chapter introduces the general class of SARIMA models, passing through the class of ARIMA models. These models allow to apply the ARMA modeling framework also to time series that have particular non-stationary components to them such as, for example, linear and/or seasonal trends. Extending ARMA modeling to these cases allows SARIMA models to be an extremely flexible class of models that can be used to describe a wide range of phenomena. 4.1 Linear Processes In order to discuss the classes of models mentioned above, we first present the class of linear processes which underlie many of the most common time series models. This class of models can be represented INSERT AN INTRODUCTION TO WHAT LINEAR PROCESSES ARE AND WHY THEY ARE IMPORTANT Definition 4.1 (Linear Process) A time series, \\((X_t)\\), is defined to be a linear process if it can be expressed as a linear combination of white noise by: \\[{X_t} = \\mu + \\sum\\limits_{j = - \\infty }^\\infty {{\\psi _j}{W_{t - j}}} \\] where \\(W_t \\sim WN(0, \\sigma^2)\\) and \\(\\sum\\limits_{j = - \\infty }^\\infty {\\left| {{\\psi _j}} \\right|} &lt; \\infty\\). Note, the latter assumption is required to ensure that the series has a limit. Furthermore, the set of coefficients \\[{\\{ {\\psi _j}\\} _{j = - \\infty , \\cdots ,\\infty }}\\] can be viewed as a linear filter. These coefficients do not have to be all equal nor symmetric as later examples will show. Generally, the properties of a linear process related to mean and variance are given by: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mu_{X} &amp;= \\mu \\\\ \\gamma_{X}(h) &amp;= \\sigma _W^2\\sum\\limits_{j = - \\infty }^\\infty {{\\psi _j}{\\psi _{h + j}}} \\end{aligned}\\] The latter is derived from \\[\\begin{aligned} \\gamma \\left( h \\right) &amp;= Cov\\left( {{x_t},{x_{t + h}}} \\right) \\\\ &amp;= Cov\\left( {\\mu + \\sum\\limits_{j = - \\infty }^\\infty {{\\psi _j}{w_{t - j}}} ,\\mu + \\sum\\limits_{j = - \\infty }^\\infty {{\\psi _j}{w_{t + h - j}}} } \\right) \\\\ &amp;= Cov\\left( {\\sum\\limits_{j = - \\infty }^\\infty {{\\psi _j}{w_{t - j}}} ,\\sum\\limits_{j = - \\infty }^\\infty {{\\psi _j}{w_{t + h - j}}} } \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\sum\\limits_{j = - \\infty }^\\infty {{\\psi _j}{\\psi _{j + h}}Cov\\left( {{w_{t - j}},{w_{t - j}}} \\right)} \\\\ &amp;= \\sigma _w^2\\sum\\limits_{j = - \\infty }^\\infty {{\\psi _j}{\\psi _{j + h}}} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Within the above derivation, the key is to realize that \\(Cov\\left( {{w_{t - j}},{w_{t + h - j}}} \\right) = 0\\) if \\(t - j \\ne t + h - j\\). Lastly, one of the better formalities of a linear process is that it is able to be represented in a simplified form under the backshift operator: \\[{X_t} = \\psi \\left( B \\right){W_t}\\] Example 4.1 (Linear Process of White Noise) The white noise process \\(\\left\\{X_t\\right\\}\\), defined in 2.3.3, can be expressed as a linear process under: \\[\\psi _j = \\begin{cases} 1 , &amp;\\mbox{ if } j = 0\\\\ 0 , &amp;\\mbox{ if } |j| \\ge 1 \\end{cases}.\\] and \\(\\mu = 0\\). Therefore, \\(X_t = W_t\\), where \\(W_t \\sim WN(0, \\sigma^2_W)\\) Example 4.2 (Linear Process of Moving Average Order 1) Similarly, consider \\(\\left\\{X_t\\right\\}\\) to be a MA(1) process, given by 2.3.6. The process can be expressed linearly under: \\[\\psi _j = \\begin{cases} 1, &amp;\\mbox{ if } j = 0\\\\ \\theta , &amp;\\mbox{ if } j = 1 \\\\ 0, &amp;\\mbox{ if } j \\ge 2 \\end{cases}.\\] and \\(\\mu = 0\\). Thus, we have: \\(X_t = W_t + \\theta W_{t-1}\\) Example 4.3 (Linear Process and Symmetric Moving Average) Consider a symmetric moving average given by: \\[{X_t} = \\frac{1}{{2q + 1}}\\sum\\limits_{j = - q}^q {{W_{t + j}}} \\] Thus, \\(\\left\\{X_t\\right\\}\\) is defined for \\(q + 1 \\le t \\le n-q\\). The above process would be a linear process since: \\[\\psi _j = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{{2q + 1}} , &amp;\\mbox{ if } -q \\le j \\le q\\\\ 0 , &amp;\\mbox{ if } |j| &gt; q \\end{cases}.\\] and \\(\\mu = 0\\). In practice, if \\(q = 1\\), we would have: \\[{X_t} = \\frac{1}{3}\\left( {{W_{t - 1}} + {W_t} + {W_{t + 1}}} \\right)\\] Example 4.4 (Linear Process of Autoregressive Process of Order 1) A more intensive application of a linear process is \\(\\left\\{X_t\\right\\}\\) as an AR1 process, defined in 2.3.5. The intensity comes from the necessity to define the weights with respect to the time lag. \\[\\psi _j = \\begin{cases} \\phi^j , &amp;\\mbox{ if } j \\ge 0\\\\ 0 , &amp;\\mbox{ if } j &lt; 0 \\end{cases}.\\] and \\(\\mu = 0\\). Under the condition that \\(\\left| \\phi \\right| &lt; 1\\) the process can be considered to be the traditional \\(X_t = \\phi X_{t-1} + W_t\\). Furthermore, the process can also be considered to be an MA(\\(\\infty\\))! 4.2 Linear Operators 4.3 Autoregressive Models (AR(p)) The class of autoregressive models is based on the idea that previous values in the time series are needed to explain current values in the series. For this class of models, we assume that the \\(p\\) previous observations are needed for this purpose and we therefore denote this class as AR(\\(p\\)). In the previous chapter, the model we introduced was an AR(1) in which only the immediately previous observation is needed to explain the following one and therefore represents a particular model which is part of the more general class of AR(p) models. (#def:ar_p) The AR(p) models can be formally represented as follows \\[{X_t} = {\\phi_1}{Y_{t - 1}} + ... + {\\phi_p}{X_{t - p}} + {W_t},\\] where \\(\\phi_p \\neq 0\\) and \\(W_t\\) is a (Gaussian) white noise process with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). In general, we will assume that the expectation of the process \\(({X_t})\\), as well as that of the following ones in this chapter, is zero. The reason for this simplification is that if \\(\\mathbb{E} [ X_t ] = \\mu\\), we can define an AR process around \\(\\mu\\) as follows: \\[X_t - \\mu = \\sum_{i = 1}^p \\left(\\phi_i X_{t-i} - \\mu \\right) + W_t,\\] which is equivalent to \\[X_t = \\mu^{\\star} + \\sum_{i = 1}^p \\phi_i X_{t-i} + W_t,\\] where \\(\\mu^{\\star} = \\mu (1 - \\sum_{i = 1}^p \\phi_i)\\). Therefore, to simplify the notation we will generally consider only zero mean processes, since adding means (as well as other deterministic trends) is easy. A useful way of representing AR processes is through the backshift operator introduced in the previous section and is as follows \\[\\begin{aligned} {X_t} &amp;= {\\phi_1}{X_{t - 1}} + ... + {\\phi_p}{y_{t - p}} + {w_t} \\\\ &amp;= {\\phi_1}B{X_t} + ... + {\\phi_p}B^p{X_t} + {W_t} \\\\ &amp;= ({\\phi_1}B + ... + {\\phi_p}B^p){X_t} + {W_t} \\\\ \\end{aligned},\\] which finally yields \\[(1 - {\\phi _1}B - ... - {\\phi_p}B^p){X_t} = {W_t},\\] which, in abbreviated form, can be expressed as \\[\\phi(B){X_t} = W_t.\\] We will see that \\(\\phi(B)\\) is important to establish the stationarity of these processes and is called the autoregressive operator. Moreover, this quantity is closely related to another important property of AR processes called causality. Before formally defining this new property, we consider the following example, which provides an intuitive illustration of its importance. Example: Consider a classical AR(1) model with \\(|\\phi| &gt; 1\\). Such a model could be expressed as \\[X_t = \\phi^{-1} X_{t+1} - \\phi^{-1} W_t = \\phi^{-k} X_{t+k} - \\sum_{i = 1}^{k-1} \\phi^{-i} W_{t+i}.\\] Since \\(|\\phi| &gt; 1\\), we obtain \\[X_t = - \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty} \\phi^{-j} W_{t-j},\\] which is a linear process and therefore is stationary. Unfortunately, such a model is useless because we need the future to predict the future and such processes are called non-causal. 4.3.1 Properties of AR(p) models In this section we will describe the main property of the AR(p) model which has already been introduced in the previous paragraphs and therefore let us now introduce the property of causality in a more formal manner. Definition: An AR(p) model is causal, if the time series \\(\\{ X_t \\}_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\) can be written as a one-sided linear process: \\[\\begin{equation} X_t = \\sum_{j = 0}^{\\infty} \\psi_j W_{t-j} = \\frac{1}{\\phi(B)} W_t = \\psi(B) W_t, \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\phi(B) = \\sum_{j = 0}^{\\infty} \\phi_j B^j\\), and \\(\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}|\\phi_j| &lt; \\infty\\); we set \\(\\phi_0 = 1\\). As discussed earlier this condition implies that only the past values of the time series can explain the future values of it, and not viceversa. However, it might be difficult and not obvious to show the causality of an AR(p) process by using the above definitions directly, thus the following properties are useful in practice. Property: Causality If an AR(p) model is causal, then the coefficients of the one-sided linear process given in ((4.1)) can be obtained by solving \\[\\begin{equation*} \\psi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\phi_j z^j} = \\frac{1}{\\phi(z)}, \\mbox{ } |z| \\leq 1. \\end{equation*}\\] It can be seen how there is no solution to the above equation if \\(\\phi(z) = 0\\) and therefore an AR(p) is causal if and only if \\(\\phi(z) \\neq 0\\). A condition for this to be respected is for the roots of \\(\\phi(z) = 0\\) to lie outside the unit circle. 4.4 Estimation of AR(p) models Given the above defined properties of the AR(p) models, we will now discuss how these models can be estimated, more specifically how the \\(p+1\\) parameters can be obtained from an observed time series. Indeed, a reliable estimation of these models is necessary in order to intepret and describe different natural phenomena and/or forecast possible future values of the time series. A first approach builds upon the earlier definition of the AR(p) as being a linear process. Recall that \\[\\begin{equation} X_t = \\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \\phi_j X_{t-j} \\end{equation}\\] which delivers the following autocovariance function \\[\\begin{equation} \\gamma(h) = cov(X_{t+h}, X_t) = cov(\\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \\phi_j X_{t-j}, X_t) = \\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \\phi_j \\gamma(h-j), \\mbox{ } h \\geq 0. \\end{equation}\\] Rearranging the above expressions we obtain the following general equations \\[\\begin{equation} \\gamma(h) - \\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \\phi_j \\gamma(h-j) = 0, \\mbox{ } h \\geq 1 \\end{equation}\\] and, recalling that \\(\\gamma(h) = \\gamma(-h)\\), \\[\\begin{equation} \\gamma(0) - \\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \\phi_j \\gamma(j) = \\sigma_w^2. \\end{equation}\\] We can now define the Yule-Walker equations. Definition: The Yule-Walker equations are given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\gamma(h) = \\phi_1 \\gamma(h-1) + ... + \\phi_p \\gamma(h-p), \\mbox{ } h = 1,...,p \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma_w^2 = \\gamma(0) - \\phi_1 \\gamma(1) - ... - \\phi_p \\gamma(p). \\end{equation}\\] which in matrix notation can be defined as follows \\[\\begin{equation} \\Gamma_p \\mathbf{\\phi} = \\mathbf{\\gamma}_p \\text{and} \\sigma_w^2 = \\gamma(0) - \\mathbf{\\phi}&#39;\\mathbf{\\gamma}_p \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Gamma_p\\) is the \\(p\\times p\\) matrix containing the autocovariances \\(\\gamma(k-j), j,k = 1, ...,p\\) while \\(\\mathbf{\\phi} = (\\phi_1,...,\\phi_p)&#39;\\) and \\(\\mathbf{\\gamma}_p = (\\gamma(1),...,\\gamma(p))&#39;\\) are \\(p\\times 1\\) vectors. Considering the Yule-Walker equations, it is possible to use a method of moments approach and simply replace the theoretical quantities given in the previous definition with their empirical (estimated) counterparts that we saw in the previous chapter. This gives us the following Yule-Walker estimators \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}} = \\hat{\\Gamma}_p^{-1}\\hat{\\mathbf{\\gamma}}_p \\text{and} \\hat{\\sigma}_w^2 = \\hat{\\gamma}(0) - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\gamma}}_p&#39;\\hat{\\Gamma}_p^{-1}\\hat{\\mathbf{\\gamma}}_p \\end{equation}\\] These estimators have the following asymptotic properties. Property: Consistency and Asymptotic Normality of Yule-Walker estimators The Yule-Walker estimators for a causal AR(p) model have the following asymptotic properties: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sqrt{T}(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}- \\mathbf{\\phi}) \\xrightarrow{\\mathcal{D}} \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\sigma_w^2\\Gamma_p^{-1}) \\text{and} \\hat{\\sigma}_w^2 \\xrightarrow{\\mathcal{P}} \\sigma_w^2 . \\end{equation*}\\] Therefore the Yule-Walker estimators have an asymptotically normal distribution and the estimator of the innovation variance is consistent. Moreover, these estimators are also optimal for AR(p) models, meaning that they are also efficient. However, there exists another method which allows to achieve this efficiency also for general ARMA models and this is the maximum likelihood method. Considering an AR(1) model as an example, and assuming without loss of generality that the expectation is zero, we have the following representation of the AR(1) model \\[\\begin{equation*} X_t = \\phi X_{t-1} + w_t \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(|\\phi|&lt;1\\) and \\(w_t \\overset{iid}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_w^2)\\). Supposing we have observations issued from this model \\((x_t)_{t=1,...,T}\\), then the likelihood function for this setting is given by \\[\\begin{equation*} L(\\phi,\\sigma_w^2) = f(\\phi,\\sigma_w^2|x_1,...,x_T) \\end{equation*}\\] which, for an AR(1) model, can be rewritten as follows \\[\\begin{equation*} L(\\phi,\\sigma_w^2) = f(x_1)f(x_2|x_1)\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot f(x_T|x_{T-1}). \\end{equation*}\\] If we define \\(\\Omega_t^p\\) as the information contained in the previous \\(p\\) observations to time \\(t\\), the above can be generalized for an AR(p) model as follows \\[\\begin{equation*} L(\\phi,\\sigma_w^2) = f(x_1,...,x_p)f(x_{p+1}|\\Omega_{p+1}^p)\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot f(x_T|\\Omega_{T-1}^p) \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(f(x_1,...,x_p)\\) is the joint probability distribution of the first \\(p\\) observations. A discussion on how to find \\(f(x_1,...,x_p)\\) will be presented in the following paragraphs based on the approach to find \\(f(x_1)\\) in the AR(1) likelihood. Going back to the latter, we know that \\(x_t|x_{t-1} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\phi x_{t-1},\\sigma_w^2)\\) and therefore we have that \\[\\begin{equation*} f(x_t|x_{t-1}) = f_w(x_t - \\phi x_{t-1}) \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(f_w(\\cdot)\\) is the distribution of \\(w_t\\). This rearranges the likelihood function as follows \\[\\begin{equation*} L(\\phi,\\sigma_w^2) = f(x_1)\\prod_{t=2}^T f_w(x_t - \\phi x_{t-1}) \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(f(x_1)\\) can be found through the causal representation \\[\\begin{equation*} x_1 = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\phi^j w_{1-j} \\end{equation*}\\] which implies that \\(x_1\\) follows a normal distribution with zero expectation and a variance given by \\(\\frac{\\sigma_w^2}{(1-\\phi^2)}\\). Based on this, the likelihood function of an AR(1) finally becomes \\[\\begin{equation*} L(\\phi,\\sigma_w^2) = (2\\pi \\sigma_w^2)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} (1 - \\phi)^2 \\exp \\left(-\\frac{S(\\phi)}{2 \\sigma_w^2}\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] with \\(S(\\phi) = (1-\\phi)^2 x_1^2 + \\sum_{t=2}^T (x_t -\\phi x_{t-1})^2\\). Once the derivative of the logarithm of the likelihood is taken, the minimization of the negative of this function is usually done numerically. However, if we condition on the initial values, the AR(p) models are linear and, for example, we can then define the conditional likelihood of an AR(1) as \\[\\begin{equation*} L(\\phi,\\sigma_w^2|x_1) = (2\\pi \\sigma_w^2)^{-\\frac{n-1}{2}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{S_c(\\phi)}{2 \\sigma_w^2}\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] where \\[\\begin{equation*} S_c(\\phi) = \\sum_{t=2}^T (x_t -\\phi x_{t-1})^2 . \\end{equation*}\\] The latter is called the conditional sum of squares and \\(\\phi\\) can be estimated as a straightforward linear regression problem. Once an estimate \\(\\hat{\\phi}\\) is obtained, this can be used to obtain the conditional maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\sigma_w^2\\) \\[\\begin{equation*} \\hat{\\sigma}_w^2 = \\frac{S_c(\\hat{\\phi})}{(n-1)} . \\end{equation*}\\] The estimation methods presented so far are standard ones for these kind of models. Nevertheless, if the data suffers from some form of contamination, these methods can become highly biased. For this reason, some robust estimators are available to limit this problematic if there are indeed outliers in the observed time series. A first solution is given by the estimator proposed in Kunsch (1984) who underlines that the MLE score function of an AR(p) is given by \\[\\begin{equation*} \\kappa(\\mathbf{\\theta}|x_j,...x_{j+p}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{\\theta}} (x_{j+p} - \\sum_{k=1}^p \\phi_k x_{j+p-k})^2 \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the parameter vector containing, in the case of an AR(1) model, the two parameters \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\sigma_w^2\\) (i.e.\\(\\theta = [\\phi \\,\\, \\sigma_w^2]\\)). This delivers the estimating equation \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_{j=1}^{n-p} \\kappa (\\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}}|x_j,...x_{j+p}) = 0 . \\end{equation*}\\] The score function \\(\\kappa(\\cdot)\\) is clearly not bounded, in the sense that if we arbitrarily move a value of \\((x_t)\\) to infinity then the score function also goes to infinity thereby delivering a biased estimation procedure. To avoid that outlying observations bias the estimation excessively, a bounded score function can be used to deliver an M-estimator given by \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_{j=1}^{n-p} \\psi (\\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}}|x_j,...x_{j+p}) = 0, \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(\\psi(\\cdot)\\) is a function of bounded variation. When conditioning on the first \\(p\\) observations, this problem can be brought back to a linear regression problem which can be applied in a robust manner using the robust regression tools available in R such as rlm(...) or lmrob(...). However, another available tool in R which can applied directly without conditioning also for general ARMA models is the gmwm(...) function which, by specifying the option robust = TRUE. This function makes use of a quantity called the wavelet variance (denoted as \\(\\nu\\)) which is estimated robustly and then used to retrieve the parameters \\(\\theta\\) of the time series model. The robust estimate is obtained by solving the following minimization problem \\[\\begin{equation*} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\underset{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}}{\\text{argmin}} (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}} - \\boldsymbol{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}))^T\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}} - \\boldsymbol{\\nu}({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})), \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(\\hat{\\nu}\\) is the robustly estimated wavelet variance, \\(\\nu{\\theta}\\) is the theoretical wavelet variance and \\(\\Omega\\) is positive definite weighting matrix. Below we show some simulation studies where we present the results of the above estimation procedures in absence and in presence of contamination in the data. In particular, we simulate three different processes \\(X_t, Y_t, Z_t\\) from \\[X_t = 0.5 X_{t-1} - 0.25 X_{t-2} + W_t\\] with \\(W_t \\sim WN(0, 1)\\). Within two of the processes, we apply either a process-wise contamination or a pointwise contamination. The process wise contamination, \\(Y_t\\), has a portion of the original process, \\(X_t\\) replaced with concurrent samples from \\[U_t = 0.90 U_{t-1} - 0.40 U_{t-2} + V_t\\], where \\(V_t \\sim WN(0, 9)\\) whereas the point-wise contaimination, \\(Z_t\\), has points selected at random from \\(X_t\\) and replaced with \\(N_t \\sim WN(0, 9)\\). n = 1000 # Sample Size gamma = 0.05 # Level of contamination dispersal = round(gamma*n) # Amount of samples contaminated set.seed(19) # Set seed for reproducibility # Generate data! Xt = gen_gts(n, AR(phi = c(0.5,0.25), sigma2 = 1)) Yt = gen_gts(n, AR(phi = c(0.5,0.25), sigma2 = 1)) Zt = gen_gts(n, AR(phi = c(0.5,0.25), sigma2 = 1)) # Contaminate a portion of Y_t with a process Yt[101:135,] = gen_gts(35, AR(phi = c(0.9,-0.4), sigma2 = 9)) # Contaminate at random Z_t with noise Zt[sample(n, dispersal, replace = FALSE),] = gen_gts(dispersal, WN(sigma2 = 9)) Figure 4.1: Contaminated AR(2) Processes As every process will require the same estimation methodology, we will first define a computational engine that will compute estimates for the parameters across all of the different methods under the simulation study. Doing so provides separate, reusable code that lowers the threshold for error when compared to having multiple copies of the same code scattered about. In addition, we have defined a means to visualize the results obtained from the simulation study through a boxplot. The procedure for creating the graphs is detailed after the simulation engine. sim_engine = function(Xt){ # Estimate ARIMA parameters using MLE mod = arima(Xt, order = c(2, 0, 0), include.mean = FALSE) # Extract MLE Parameters (including sigma) res.MLE = c(mod$coef, mod$sigma) # Calculate ACF autocorr = as.numeric(acf(Xt, lag.max = 2, plot = FALSE)$acf) X = matrix(1,2,2) X[1,2] = X[2,1] = autocorr[2] y = autocorr[2:3] # Compute Least Squares on ACF svmat = solve(X) phi.LS = svmat%*%y sig2.LS = var(Xt)*(1 - t(y)%*%svmat%*%y) res.LS = c(phi.LS, sig2.LS) # Calculate RACF rob.ccf = as.numeric(robcor::robacf(Xt, plot=FALSE, type = &quot;covariance&quot;)$acf) X[1,2] = X[2,1] = rob.ccf[2]/rob.ccf[1] y = rob.ccf[2:3]/rob.ccf[1] # Compute Least Squares on RACF svmat = solve(X) phi.RR = svmat%*%y sig2.RR = rob.ccf[1]*(1 - t(y)%*%svmat%*%y) res.RR = c(phi.RR, sig2.RR) # Compute the GMWM Estimator res.GMWM = gmwm2::gmwm(ARMA(2,0), Xt)$estimate res.RGMWM = gmwm2::gmwm(ARMA(2,0), Xt, robust = TRUE)$estimate # Return results list(res.MLE = res.MLE, res.LS = res.LS, res.RR = res.RR, res.GMWM = res.GMWM, res.RGMWM = res.RGMWM) } sim_study_graph = function(res.MLE, res.LS, res.RR, res.GMWM, res.RGMWM, Truth = c(0.5, 0.25, 1)){ # Converts Simulation Matrices to Long Form for use in ggplot2 d = bmisc::study_df(res.MLE, res.LS, res.RR, res.GMWM, res.RGMWM, data_names = c(&quot;MLE&quot;,&quot;LS&quot;,&quot;RLS&quot;,&quot;GMWM&quot;,&quot;RGMWM&quot;)) # Reorder factors d$Draw = factor(d$Draw, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = expression(phi[1], phi[2], sigma^2)) d$Type = factor(d$Type, levels = c(&quot;MLE&quot;,&quot;LS&quot;,&quot;RLS&quot;,&quot;GMWM&quot;,&quot;RGMWM&quot;)) # Add in horizontal lines oracle = data.frame(Draw = 1:3, Truth = Truth) oracle$Draw = factor(oracle$Draw, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = expression(phi[1], phi[2], sigma^2)) # Plot ggplot(d, aes(x = Type, y = Values, fill = Type)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_boxplot(geom =&#39;errorbar&#39;, width = 0.5) + geom_hline(data = oracle, aes(yintercept = Truth), color = &quot;red&quot;) + facet_wrap(~Draw, labeller = label_parsed, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;, axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50, hjust = 1)) } With the means to now compute and visualize parameter estimates for each of the given methods, the bootrap simulation study may now commence.

["appendixa.html", "A Proofs A.1 Proof of Theorem 1 😱", " A Proofs A.1 Proof of Theorem 1 😱 We let \\(X_t = W_t + \\mu\\), where \\(\\mu &lt; \\infty\\) and \\((W_t)\\) is a strong white noise process with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) and finite fourth moment (i.e. \\(\\mathbb{E} [W_t^4] &lt; \\infty\\)). Next, we consider the sample autocovariance function computed on \\((X_t)\\), i.e. \\[ \\hat \\gamma \\left( h \\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t = 1}^{n - h} {\\left( {{X_t} - \\bar X} \\right)\\left( {{X_{t + h}} - \\bar X} \\right)}. \\] For this equation, it is clear that \\(\\hat \\gamma \\left( 0 \\right)\\) and \\(\\hat \\gamma \\left( h \\right)\\) (with \\(h &gt; 0\\)) are two statistics involving sums of different lengths.

However, the lag \\(h\\) is fixed and therefore the difference in the number of elements of both sums is asymptotically negligible.

["appendixb.html", "B Robust Regression Methods B.1 The Classical Least-Squares Estimator B.2 Robust Estimators for Linear Regression Models B.3 Applications of Robust Estimation", " B Robust Regression Methods This appendix is largely based on the introduction to linear robust regression presented in Ronchetti (2006) and Duncan and Guerrier (2016). In these references it is stated that the vast majority of the statistical models employed in different fields going from finance to biology and engineering, for example, are parametric models. Based on these models, assumptions are made concerning the properties of the variables of interest (and the models themselves) and optimal procedures are derived under these assumptions. Among these procedures, the least squares and maximum likelihood estimators are well known examples that, however, are only optimal when the underlying statistical assumptions are exactly satisfied. If the latter case does not hold, then these procedures can become considerably biased and/or inefficient when there exist small deviations from the model. The results obtained by classical procedures can therefore be misleading when applied to real data (see e.g. Ronchetti (2006) and Huber and Ronchetti (2009)). In order to address the problems arising from violated parametric assumptions, robust statistics can be seen as an extension to classical parametric statistics by directly considering the deviations from the models. Indeed, while parametric models may be a good approximation of the true underlying situation, robust statistics does not assume that the model is exactly correct. A robust procedure as stated in Huber and Ronchetti (2009) therefore should have the following features: It should efficiently estimate the assumed model. It should be reliable and reasonably efficient under small deviations from the model (e.g. when the distribution lies in a neighborhood of the assumed model). Larger deviations from the model should not affect the estimation procedure excessively. A robust estimation method is a compromise with respect to these three features. This compromise is illustrated by Anscombe and Guttman (1960) using an insurance metaphor: “sacrifice some efficiency at the model in order to insure against accidents caused by deviations from the model”. It is often believed that robust procedures may be avoided by using the following two-step procedure: Clean the data using some rule for outlier rejection. Apply classical optimal procedures on the “clean” data. Unfortunately such procedures cannot replace robust methods as discussed in Huber and Ronchetti (2009) for the following reasons: It is rarely possible to seperate the two steps. For example, in a parametric regression setting, outliers are difficult to recognize without reliable (i.e. robust) estimates of the model’s parameters. The cleaned data will not correspond to the assumed model since there will be statistical errors of both kinds (false acceptance and false rejection). Therefore in general the classical theory is not applicable to the cleaned sample. Empirically, the best rejection procedures do not reach the performance of the best robust procedures. The latter are apparently superior because they can make a smoother transition between the full acceptance and full rejection of an observation using weighting procedures Hampel et al. (1987). Empirical studies have also shown that many of the classical rejection methods are unable to deal with multiple outliers. Indeed, it is possible that a second outlier “masks” the effect of the first so that neither are rejected. Unfortunately the least squares estimator suffers from a dramatic lack of robustness. A single outlier can have an arbitrarily large effect on the estimated parameters. In order to assess the robustness of an estimator we first need to introduce an important concept, namely the influence function. This concept was introduced in Hampel (1968) and it formalizes the bias caused by one outlier. The influence function of an estimator represents the effect of an infinitesimal contamination at the point \\(x\\) or (\\(\\mathbf{x}\\), \\(y\\)) in the regression setting) on the estimate, standardized by the mass of contamination. Mathematically, the influence function of the estimator \\(T\\) for the model \\(F\\) is given by: \\[\\text{IF}(x| T, F) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{T\\left((1-\\varepsilon) F + \\varepsilon \\Delta_x \\right) - T\\left(F\\right)}{\\varepsilon}\\] where \\(\\Delta_x\\) is a probability measure which puts mass \\(1\\) at the point \\(x\\). B.1 The Classical Least-Squares Estimator The standard definition of the linear model is derived as follows. Let \\({(\\mathbf{x}_{i},y_{i}): i = 1, \\ldots, n}\\) be a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables such that: \\[y_{i} = \\mathbf{x}_{i}^{T} {\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} + u_{i}\\] where \\(y_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is the \\(i\\)-th observation, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}\\) is the \\(i\\)-th row of the design matrix \\(\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\) is a p-vector of unknown parameters, \\(u_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is the \\(i\\)-th error. The least-squares estimator \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}\\) of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) can be expressed as an \\(M\\)-estimator1 Least-squares estimators are an example of the larger class of \\(M\\)-estimators. The definition of \\(M\\)-estimators was motivated by robust statistics which delivered new types of \\(M\\)-estimators. defined by the estimating equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\left(y_{i} - \\mathbf{x}_{i}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\right)\\mathbf{x}_{i} = 0. \\tag{B.1} \\end{equation}\\] This estimator is optimal under the following assumptions: \\(u_{i}\\) are normally distributed. \\(\\mathbb{E}[u_{i}] = 0\\) for \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\). \\(Cov(u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{n}) = \\sigma^2 \\, \\mathbf{I}_{n}\\) where \\(\\mathbf{I}_{n}\\) denotes the identity matrix of size \\(n\\). In other words, least-squares estimation is only optimal when the errors are normally distributed. Small departures from the normality assumption for the errors results in considerable loss of efficiency of the least-squares estimator (see Hampel et al. (1987), Huber (1973) and Hampel (1973)). B.2 Robust Estimators for Linear Regression Models The “Huber estimator” introduced in Huber (1973) was one of the first robust estimation methods applied to linear models. Basically, this estimator is a weighted version of the least-squares estimate with weights of the form: \\[ w_{i} = \\min \\left(1,\\frac{c}{|r_{i}|}\\right) \\] where \\(r_{i}\\) is the \\(i\\)-th residual and \\(c\\) is a positive constant which controls the trade-off between robustness and efficiency. Huber proposed an -estimator \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{H}\\) of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) defined by the estimating equation: \\[ \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\psi_{c}\\left(y_{i} - \\mathbf{x}_{i}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\right)\\mathbf{x}_{i} = 0 \\] where \\(\\psi_{c}(\\cdot)\\) corresponds to Huber’s weight function \\[\\begin{equation} w\\left({x}\\right) = \\begin{cases} 1, &amp;\\text{if } \\left|{x}\\right| \\le k \\\\ \\frac{k}{\\left|{x}\\right|}, &amp;\\text{if} \\left|{x}\\right| &gt; k \\end{cases} \\tag{B.2} \\end{equation}\\] and, thus, is defined as: \\[ \\psi_{c}(r) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l l} r &amp; \\quad \\\\ c \\cdot \\text{sign}(r). &amp; \\quad \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] However, the Huber estimator cannot cope with problems caused by outlying points in the design (or covariate) matrix \\(X\\). An estimator which was developed to address this particular issue is the one proposed by Mallows which has the important property that the influence function is bounded also for the matrix \\(X\\) (see Krasker (1980) for more details). B.3 Applications of Robust Estimation Having rapidly highlighted the theory of robustness, we now focus on the application of robust techniques in practical settings. Over the next three examples, estimation between classical or traditional methods will be compared with robust methods to illustrate the usefulness of using the latter techniques can have in specific scenarios. Example B.1 Consider a simple linear model with Gaussian errors such as \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = \\alpha + \\beta x_i + \\varepsilon_i, \\;\\; \\varepsilon_i \\overset{iid}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2) \\tag{B.3} \\end{equation}\\] for \\(i = 1,...,n\\). Next, we set the parameter values \\(\\alpha = 5\\), \\(\\beta = 0.5\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\) in order to simulate 20 observations from the above simple linear model where we define \\(x_i = i\\) for \\(i = 1,...,20\\). In the left panel of Figure B.1, we present the simulated observations together with the fitted regression lines obtained by least-squares and a robust estimation method. It can be observed that both lines are very similar and “close” to the true model given by \\(y_i = 5 + 0.5 i\\). Indeed, although the robust estimator pays a small price in terms of efficiency compared to the the least-squares estimator, the two methods generally deliver very “similar” results when the model assumption holds. On the other hand, the robust estimators provide (in general) far more reliable results when outliers are present in a data-set. To illustrate this behavior we modify the last observation by setting \\(\\varepsilon_{20} = -10\\) (which is “extreme” under the assumption that \\(\\varepsilon_i \\overset{iid}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\)). The modified observations are presented in the right panel of Figure B.1 together with the fitted regression lines. In this case, the least-squares is strongly influenced by the outlier we introduced while the robust estimator remains stable and “close” to the true model. # Load robust library library(&quot;robustbase&quot;) # Set seed for reproducibility set.seed(867) # Sample size n = 20 # Model&#39;s parameters alpha = 5 # Intercept beta = 0.5 # Slope sig2 = 1 # Residual variance # Construct response variable y x = 1:n y = alpha + beta*x + rnorm(n,0,sqrt(sig2)) # Construct &quot;perturbed&quot; verison of y y.perturbed = y y.perturbed[20] = alpha + beta*x[20] - 10 # Compute LS estimates LS.y = lm(y ~ x) LS.y.fit = coef(LS.y)[1] + coef(LS.y)[2]*x LS.y.pert = lm(y.perturbed ~ x) LS.y.pert.fit = coef(LS.y.pert)[1] + coef(LS.y.pert)[2]*x # Compute robust estimates RR.y = lmrob(y ~ x) RR.y.fit = coef(RR.y)[1] + coef(RR.y)[2]*x RR.y.pert = lmrob(y.perturbed ~ x) RR.y.pert.fit = coef(RR.y.pert)[1] + coef(RR.y.pert)[2]*x # Define colors gg_color_hue &lt;- function(n, alpha = 1) { hues = seq(15, 375, length = n + 1) hcl(h = hues, l = 65, c = 100, alpha = alpha)[1:n] } couleurs = gg_color_hue(6) # Compare results based on y and y.perturbed par(mfrow = c(1,2)) plot(NA, ylim = range(cbind(y,y.perturbed)), xlim = range(x), main = &quot;Uncontaminated setting&quot;, xlab = &quot;x&quot;, ylab = &quot;y&quot;) grid() points(x,y, pch = 16, col = couleurs[4]) lines(x, alpha + beta*x, col = couleurs[3], lty = 2) lines(x, LS.y.fit, col = couleurs[5]) lines(x, RR.y.fit, col = couleurs[1]) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;,c(&quot;Observations&quot;,&quot;Estimated model (least-squares)&quot;, &quot;Estimated model (robust)&quot;, &quot;True model&quot;), lwd = c(NA,1,1,1), col = couleurs[c(4,5,1,3)], lty = c(NA,1,1,2), bty = &quot;n&quot;, pch = c(16,NA,NA,NA)) plot(NA, ylim = range(cbind(y,y.perturbed)), xlim = range(x), main = &quot;Contaminated setting&quot;, xlab = &quot;x&quot;, ylab = &quot;y&quot;) grid() points(x[1:19],y.perturbed[1:19], pch = 16, col = couleurs[4]) points(x[20], y.perturbed[20], pch = 15, col = couleurs[6]) lines(x, alpha + beta*x, col = couleurs[3], lty = 2) lines(x, LS.y.pert.fit, col = couleurs[5]) lines(x, RR.y.pert.fit, col = couleurs[1]) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;,c(&quot;Uncontamined observations&quot;, &quot;Contamined observation&quot;, &quot;Estimated model (least-squares)&quot;, &quot;Estimated model (robust)&quot;, &quot;True model&quot;), lwd = c(NA,NA,1,1,1), col = couleurs[c(4,6,5,1,3)], lty = c(NA,NA,1,1,2), bty = &quot;n&quot;, pch = c(16,15,NA,NA,NA)) Figure B.1: Simulation Study Comparing Robust and Classical Regression Methodologies Example B.2 (Robust v.

The next example presents a simulation study where the robust and classical techniques will be compared in order to show that the previous example was not due to a “lucky” sample favorable to the robust approach. To do so, the simulation study will generate 100 realizations from the model in the previous example and use the same robust and classical estimators to retrieve the parameters for each of the 100 iterations. # Number of bootstrap replications B = 10^3 # Initialisation coef.LS.cont = coef.rob.cont = matrix(NA,B,2) coef.LS.uncont = coef.rob.uncont = matrix(NA,B,2) # Start Monte-carlo for (j in 1:2){ for (i in seq_len(B)) { # Control seed set.seed(2*j*B + i) # Uncontaminated case if (j == 1){ y = alpha + beta*x + rnorm(n,0,sqrt(sig2)) coef.LS.uncont[i,] = as.numeric(lm(y ~ x)$coef) coef.rob.uncont[i,] = as.numeric(lmrob(y ~ x)$coef) } # Contaminated case if (j == 2){ y = alpha + beta*x + rnorm(n,0,sqrt(sig2)) y[20] = alpha + beta*x[20] - 10 coef.LS.cont[i,] = as.numeric(lm(y ~ x)$coef) coef.rob.cont[i,] = as.numeric(lmrob(y ~ x)$coef) } } } # Make graph colors = gg_color_hue(6, alpha = 0.5) names = c(&quot;LS - uncont&quot;,&quot;Rob - uncont&quot;,&quot;LS - cont&quot;,&quot;Rob - cont&quot;) par(mfrow = c(1,2)) boxplot(coef.LS.uncont[,1],coef.rob.uncont[,1],coef.LS.cont[,1], coef.rob.cont[,1], main = expression(alpha), col = colors[c(5,1,5,1)], cex.main = 1.5, xaxt = &quot;n&quot;) axis(1, labels = FALSE) text(x = seq_along(names), y = par(&quot;usr&quot;)[3] - 0.15, srt = 45, adj = 1, labels = names, xpd = TRUE) abline(h = alpha, lwd = 2) boxplot(coef.LS.uncont[,2],coef.rob.uncont[,2],coef.LS.cont[,2], coef.rob.cont[,2], main = expression(beta), col = colors[c(5,1,5,1)], cex.main = 1.5, xaxt = &quot;n&quot;) axis(1, labels = FALSE) text(x = seq_along(names), y = par(&quot;usr&quot;)[3] - 0.015, srt = 45, adj = 1, labels = names, xpd = TRUE) abline(h = beta, lwd = 2) It can be seen that, as underlined earlier, that the estimations resulting from the two methods appear to be quite similar, with the robust estimator performing slightly less efficiently than the classical estimator. However, under the contaminated setting it is evident how the robust estimation procedure is not affected much by the outliers in the simulated data while the classical techniques appear to be highly biased. Therefore, if there appear to be outliers in the data, a robust estimation procedure may considered preferable. In fact, the results of the two estimations could be compared to understand if there appears to be some deviation from the model assumptions. Example B.3 A practical example which underlines the usefulness of robust estimation procedures is given by the dataset that contains the properties of 47 stars from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the star cluster CYG OB1 in the direction of Cygnus. From the plot it can be observed that there appears to be a cluster of four stars on the upper left hand-side of the plot. The rest of the data however appears to have a reasonably good linear behavior. colors = gg_color_hue(6) data(starsCYG, package = &quot;robustbase&quot;) par(mfrow = c(1,1)) plot(NA, xlim = range(starsCYG$log.Te) + c(-0.1,0.1), ylim = range(starsCYG$log.light), xlab = &quot;Temperature at the surface of the star (log)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Light intensity (log)&quot;) grid() points(starsCYG, col = colors[4], pch = 16) LS = lm(starsCYG$log.light ~ starsCYG$log.Te) rob = lmrob(starsCYG$log.light ~ starsCYG$log.Te) x = seq(from = min(starsCYG$log.Te)-0.3, to = max(starsCYG$log.Te)+0.3, length.out = 4) fit.LS = coef(LS)[1] + x*coef(LS)[2] fit.rob = coef(rob)[1] + x*coef(rob)[2] lines(x, fit.LS, col = colors[5]) lines(x, fit.rob, col = colors[1]) legend(&quot;topright&quot;,c(&quot;Observations&quot;,&quot;Estimated model (least-squares)&quot;, &quot;Estimated model (robust)&quot;), lwd = c(NA,1,1), col = colors[c(4,5,1)], lty = c(NA,1,1), bty = &quot;n&quot;, pch = c(16,NA,NA)) Figure B.2: Comparison of Estimation Methodologies on 47 observations from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the star cluster CYG OB1 in the direction of Cygnus. From Figure B.2 it can be seen that classical linear regression is considerably affected by the cloud of apparent outliers on the left hand side of the plot. As a result, the regression line has a negative slope when the majority of the data appears to have a clear positive linear trend. The latter is however the case when using a robust approach which indeed detects a positive linear trend. Having said this, there are in fact two distinct populations in the data consisting in “giants” (upper left corner) and “main sequencers” (right handside). Thus, when observing data in general it is always necessary to understand if we are dealing with real outliers (unexplained outlying data) or simply with data that can be explained by other factors (e.g. a different population as in this example). summary(LS) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = starsCYG$log.light ~ starsCYG$log.Te) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.1052 -0.5067 0.1327 0.4423 0.9390 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.
